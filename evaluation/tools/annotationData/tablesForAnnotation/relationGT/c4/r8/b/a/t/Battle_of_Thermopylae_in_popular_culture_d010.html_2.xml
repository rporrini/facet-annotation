	<text>The high-quality delicate Leonidas Chocolate produced in Belgium does not recall a heroic battle to the death or the frugal food associated with ancient Sparta, the explanation being that the chocolate company is named for its Greek founder Leonidas Daskalid s , whose name ultimately derives from the Spartan king.
