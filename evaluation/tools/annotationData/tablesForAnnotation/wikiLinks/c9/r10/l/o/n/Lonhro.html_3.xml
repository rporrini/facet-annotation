	<text>Lonhro was then retired to Woodlands Stud, the place of his birth to stand next to his own sire Octagonal. His initial fee was announced as AUD$66,000 a record for local first season stallions but comparable with first season shuttle horses from the Northern Hemisphere. While there was some discussion over the price Lonhro is arguably the best performed stallion to retire to stud in Australia since Tulloch in the early 1960s.</text>

	<text>Lonhro returned home to Sydney for his last two races before retirement. Both Octagonal and Lonhro were known for arriving at the barriers, stopping with head up and looking for the winning post (closely monitored by the on-track camera), then calmly walking into the barriers. On 3 April 2004, Lonhro competed in his second George Ryder S-Gr1 (1500m). His sire Octagonal (brought down from Woodlands Stud for the event) came into the mounting yard first, followed by Lonhro much to the delight of the waiting media and huge crowd of fans come to see father+son. Octagonal then lead out the field, who then galloped down the straight as the field went to the barriers. The field jumped and Lonhro settled at the rear as usual. It was an evenly run race round the Rosehill track. In the final 100m Lonhro started to race away winning by 2 1/2 lengths from Grand Armee with a further 1 1/2 lengths to Private Steer who was to win the Doncaster - All Aged S- Gr1 double at her next two starts. On the final day of the AJC carnival, Lonhro lined up for his final race start in his second Queen Elizabeth Stakes -Gr1 (2000m). Again, Lonhro settled near the rear but Grand Armee&apos;s rider took him out to the lead at a fast pace. By the 800m Grand Armee was five lengths in front of Pentastic and nearly eight lengths ahead of Lonhro and was barely going 3/4 pace. Passing the 600m Grand Armee was let stride a mile in front of Pentastic and Sound Action with Lonhro making ground on the outside of the field already well away from the inside rail. On straightening Grand Armee was at full speed and well clear as Lonhro hurtled down the outside rail with Pentastic battling on. By the 300m it was obvious fans&apos; worst fears had come true. Grand Armee was full of running and three lengths clear of Lonhro who made slight ground but the head start made the task impossible. Grand Armee was ridden right out to the line winning officially by six lengths from Lonhro who was eased up.</text>

	<text>The field featured the stars of the spring with Lonhro joined by Makybe Diva ( Melbourne Cup ), Mummify ( Caulfield Cup ), Elvstroem ( VRC Derby ) plus Group 1 winner Sound Action, promising 3yo Delzao and the honest stayer Pentastic. On settling, Physique led Mummify then Sound Action followed by Lonhro inside Delzao then Zacielo followed by Elvstroem, then Pentastic with Zazzman and Makybe Diva at the rear. Little changed to the turn where Physique led Mummify with Sound Action joining them with Lonhro pocketed as Delzao improved with Elvstroem next. With 300m left, Physique led Mummify and Sound Action with Lonhro trying to take the run between the pair but it closed as they drifted together. Lonhro was checked and Delzao held him in the pocket. With 200m left, Mummify and Sound Action were fighting it out as Delzao made his run forcing Lonhro to check again and turn sideways to get clear on the outside but with a lot of ground to make up and his rhythm gone. By the 100m Delzao was two lengths clear and responding to his rider&apos;s hard riding from Sound Action as Lonhro got balanced to chase from Mummify with Makybe Diva making ground along the rail and Elvstroem and Pentastic out wider. The trackside crowd was going crazy and the sound levels were explosive. 50m from home Delzao was still a half-length in front but Lonhro showed his champion qualities in never giving up the chase. Slowly but surely Lonhro was gaining on the 3yo Delzao and hit the front three strides from the post to win by a half neck with a gap to Elvstroem third and Pentastic fourth. It was an emotional win for connections and race fans as even his critics realised how special Lonhro really was.</text>

	<text>After it appeared he would restart his 2004 racing in Sydney, Lonhro was a surprise entry in the C.F. Orr S-Gr1 (1400m) at Caulfield. Inside the final 100m Lonhro swept up on the outside to hit the front from Sound Action and Super Elegant as Vocabulary took a narrow run between them. Vocabulary lunged at Lonhro but he was too good winning by a half head with Sound Action third. Lonhro took on a similar field in the St George S-Gr2(1800m) two weeks later, winning eased up by 1.5 lengths. Lonhro then lined up in his final race in Melbourne in the Australian Cup-Gr1 (2000m) at Flemington and the Victorian Racing Club made the day into a farewell for the champ - all he had to do was win.</text>

	<text>Two weeks later Lonho looked invincible in the Cox Plate-Gr1 (2040m) with recent stars Sunline and Northerly missing and only Defier and Fields of Omagh joining Lonhro from the 2002 field. There were doubts over Lonhro handling the Moonee Valley surface but his class was expected to overcome any problems. Then in the 40 minutes before the race it began to rain, continuing through to the race itself. Fields of Omagh hit the lead around the turn as Defier challenged and Lonhro lost ground trying to balance up for the straight. In the straight, Fields of Omagh refused to give in to Defier with Lonhro charging down the outside. But it was too late as Fields of Omagh crossed the line to win by a long neck from Defier with Lonhro a half length away third as the rest of the field came in at intervals behind them. Lonhro returned to NSW to spell over the christmas period.</text>
