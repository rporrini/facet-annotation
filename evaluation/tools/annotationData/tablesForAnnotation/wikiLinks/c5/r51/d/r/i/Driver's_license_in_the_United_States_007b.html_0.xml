	<text>Per Federal Law, the minimum age for a to operate a commercial motor vehicle across state lines is 21. For School Bus drivers this can be as high as 25. Some individual states issue restricted Commercial Driver&apos;s License (valid in the state of issuance only) to professional drivers as young as 18. These restricted CDL&apos;s are not typically valid for driving multiple tractor trailers, hazardous materials or school buses.</text>

	<text>Drivers who are 18 or older when they first apply for a license are not subject to the graduated licensing laws. This is in stark contrast to other some other countries where all new drivers are subject to a restriction.</text>

	<score>0.6458739</score>
	<text>In addition to the above restrictions, drivers under 18 are usually required to attend a comprehensive Drivers Education program either at their high school or a professional driving school and take a certain number of behind the wheel lessons with a certified driving instructor before applying for a license. Some states like New York also require new adult drivers to attend some form of driver&apos;s education before applying for a license.</text>

	<text>In the past decade, fewer and fewer teenagers are getting driver&apos;s licenses. According to a December 2 , 2004 Los Angeles Times article, only 43% of American 15-, 16-, and 17-year olds had licenses in 2002.</text>

	<text>GDLs are subject to the same 50 state reciproicity that unrestricted licenses are (with the exception of 14-15 year old drivers operating in states that do not license individuals under 16.) Graduated license holders must always adhere to the restrictions of their home state regardless of where they are driving. Additionally, depending on local laws, underage drivers may also be subject to the GDL laws of the state they are driving in as well (although this is not always the case.)</text>

	<text>By comparison, the percentage in 1982 was 52%. The rate is even lower in some states (e.g., 9% in Missouri ). The decrease in percentages are said to be due to the many restrictions that an average teen must face overall in order to obtain the licenses.</text>

	<text>In most states , the minimum age to apply for a driver&apos;s license is 16, but is as young as 14 1/2 in South Dakota and as high as 17 in New Jersey. In all except for a few states, a graduated licensing law applies to newly licensed teenage drivers, going by names such as &quot;Provisional Driver&quot;, &quot;Junior Operator&quot;, &quot;Probationary Driver&quot; or &quot;Intermediate License.&quot; These licenses restrict certain driving privileges, normally whether the new driver may carry passengers and if so how many, as well as setting a curfew for young drivers to be off the roads (usually around midnight, but as early as 9pm in New York). Unlike some states of Australia , however, lowered speed limits and a prohibition on highway driving for new drivers are not a part of graduated licensing laws. Additionally, graduated licensing mandates tougher penalties for speeding, DUI , and certain other offenses. The restrictions typically last for the first couple of months the new driver is licensed or until he or she turns 18 (21 in Washington DC).</text>

	<text>For example, in California, newly licensed minors must wait a year before they can drive with other minors in their car, and cannot drive during certain hours of the night due to California&apos;s youth curfew . Thus, a minor can only drive with his or her friends in the car for at most one year before the minor becomes an adult.</text>
