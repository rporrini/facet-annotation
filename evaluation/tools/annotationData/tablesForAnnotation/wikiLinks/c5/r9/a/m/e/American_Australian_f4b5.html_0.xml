	<text>The ANZUS Treaty between the United States, Australia and New Zealand was signed in 1957, locking the three countries into a mutual defence pact. This increased social and political ties between Australia and the United States and led to Australia and New Zealand committing troops to the Viet Nam War in the 1960s and 1970s these connections and increased worldwide travel encouraged greater numbers of United States citizens to migrate permanently and in 1971 there were 39,035 United States-born residents in Australia</text>

	<text>During the Second World War , over a million United States soldiers were at some point stationed in Australia at the request of the Australian Government following the surrender of the British garrison in Singapore to the Japanese in 1941. When the war ended, 12,000 Australian women migrated to the United States as war brides, and 18,000 United States citizens settled in Australia including ex-servicemen as war husbands.</text>

Around this time, these American-Australians were notable in the labour movement including the formation of trade unions and the Australian Labor Party (hence Labor being spelt in the North American fashion instead of Australian Labour ). Despite North American socio-cultural influences, Australian public opinion was wary of the United States itself: the visit of the &quot;Great White Fleet&quot; of the United States Navy to Sydney and Melbourne in 1908 was greeted with fanfare</text>

	<text>In the 1850s, large numbers of United States citizens arrived, most usually after periods in gold rush California . These migrants settled predominantly in rural Victoria, where the discovery of gold had encouraged a large colony of prospectors and speculators. A number of United States-born played eminent roles in the Eureka Stockade , particularly in regard to paramilitary formations organised for self-defence by the miners. The colonial authorities suspected the United States-born amongst others, such as the Irish of disseminating republicanism .</text>
