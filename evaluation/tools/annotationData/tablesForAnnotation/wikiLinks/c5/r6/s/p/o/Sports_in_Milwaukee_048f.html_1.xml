	<text>Under the leadership of Al McGuire , Marquette&apos;s men&apos;s basketball team became a national powerhouse in the 1970s, capturing the NIT Championship in 1970, and the NCAA Championship in 1977 . Not only was the &apos;77 championship McGuire&apos;s last game, but Marquette remains the last independent school to win the title. It is also the last major sports championship won by a Milwaukee sports team.</text>

	<text>The Brewers made their first post-season appearance in 1981 and won the American League pennant in 1982. In 1998, they became the only Major League team in history to switch leagues, doing so to accommodate the expansion franchises of the Arizona Diamondbacks and Tampa Bay Devil Rays . They also have the distinction of being the only team to have played in four of the six current Major League divisions.</text>

	<text>UW-Milwaukee made its first post-season appearance in men&apos;s basketball that same year, under the tutelage of current Tennessee head coach Bruce Pearl . Although they lost at the buzzer to Notre Dame in the first round, they would make their first NIT appearance the following year. In 2005, UWM had its most successful year ever, winning both the Horizon League regular season and tournament championships. They would go on to upset Alabama in the first round of the NCAA tournament before shocking then Big East powerhouse Boston College on its way to the Sweet 16. So much of an impression had the team made that sportswriters shied away from calling their defeat of sixth-seeded Oklahoma in the 2006 Tournament an &quot;upset,&quot; believing UWM may have actually been the better team.</text>
