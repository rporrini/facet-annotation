	<text>No Best Director winning film is lost , though the nominee The Patriot is lost and nominee Sorrell and Son is incomplete. Drag (one of the films for which Frank Lloyd was nominated but did not win in 1929) has long been presumed lost, though there are rumors of its survival, possibly only on videotape, and the Vitaphone discs of its soundtrack survive. The Comedy Direction winner, Two Arabian Knights , was believed lost for many years but was preserved in the Howard Hughes archive and has been broadcast (along with another first-year nominee produced by Hughes and believed lost, The Racket ) on Turner Classic Movies .</text>

	<text>John Ford is the only director with four Best Director Oscars, followed by Frank Capra and William Wyler , with three apiece. Wyler has the most nominations, 12. Robert Altman , Clarence Brown , Alfred Hitchcock , and King Vidor are tied for the most nominations without a win, at five each.</text>

	<text>Eight people have been nominated for both Best Director and Best Actor for the same film. Warren Beatty did so twice ( Heaven Can Wait and Reds ), as did Clint Eastwood ( Unforgiven and Million Dollar Baby ). The other six included: Orson Welles ( Citizen Kane ), Laurence Olivier ( Hamlet ), Woody Allen ( Annie Hall ), Kenneth Branagh ( Henry V ), Kevin Costner ( Dances with Wolves ), and Roberto Benigni ( Life Is Beautiful ). No one has ever won both awards. Four won Best Director, but not Best Actor: Allen, Beatty (for Reds ), Costner, and Eastwood (on both occasions). Two won Best Actor, but not Best Director: Benigni and Olivier. Finally, three lost both nominations: Beatty (for Heaven Can Wait ), Branagh, and Welles.</text>

	<text>Due to strict rules promulgated by the Directors Guild of America (DGA), only one individual may claim screen credit as a film&apos;s director. (This rule is designed to prevent rights and ownership issues and to eliminate lobbying for director credit by producers and actors.) However, the DGA may create an exception to this &quot;one director per film&quot; rule if two co-directors seeking to share director credit for a film qualify as an &quot;established duo&quot;. In the history of the Academy Awards, established duos have been nominated for Best Director only three times: Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins (who won for West Side Story in 1961 ); Warren Beatty and Buck Henry (who were nominated for Heaven Can Wait in 1978 ), and Joel Coen and Ethan Coen (who won for No Country for Old Men in 2007 ).</text>

	<text>Invariably, the Academy Awards for Best Director and Best Picture have been very closely linked throughout their history. Of the 80 films that have been awarded Best Picture, 59 have also been awarded Best Director. [1] Only three films have won Best Picture without their directors being nominated (though only one since the early 1930s): Wings (1927/28), Grand Hotel (1931/32), and Driving Miss Daisy (1989). The only two Best Director winners to win for films which did not receive a Best Picture nomination are likewise in the early years: Lewis Milestone (1927/28) and Frank Lloyd (1928/29).</text>

	<text>The earliest years of the award were marked by inconsistency and confusion. In the Academy Awards&apos; first year, actors and others such as cinematographers were nominated for all of their films produced during the qualifying period. However, since the directing award was for &quot;directing&quot; rather than &quot;best director&quot;, it honored the director in association with only a single film -- thus Janet Gaynor has two Frank Borzage films listed after her Best Actress nomination, but only one of them earned Borzage a directing nomination. The second year, the directing award followed the others in listing all of a director&apos;s work during the qualifying period, resulting in Frank Lloyd being nominated for three of his films -- but, even more confusingly, only one of them was listed on the final award as the film for which he won. Finally, for the 1930/31 awards, this confusing system was replaced by the current system in which a director is nominated for a single film.</text>

	<text>Throughout the past 80 years, accounting for ties and repeat winners, AMPAS has presented a total of 81 Best Director awards to 61 different directors. At the 1st Academy Awards ( 1927 / 1928 ), there were two directing awards -- one for &quot;Dramatic Direction&quot; and one for &quot;Comedy Direction&quot;. The Comedy Direction award was eliminated the next year and, indeed, the awards have overwhelmingly favored dramatic films ever since. At both the 34th Academy Awards ( 1961 ) and the 80th Academy Awards ( 2007 ), Best Director was presented to a co-directing team, rather than to an individual director.</text>
