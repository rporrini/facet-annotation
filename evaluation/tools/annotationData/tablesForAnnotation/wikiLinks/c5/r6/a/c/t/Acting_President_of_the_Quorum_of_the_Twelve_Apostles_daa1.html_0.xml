Primarily, these duties consist of presiding at and conducting the weekly meetings of the Quorum in the Salt Lake Temple ; making decisions about the particular assignments to be made to the members of the Quorum; and acting as a liaison in coordinating the work of the Quorum with the First Presidency, the Quorums of the Seventy , and the Presiding Bishopric .</text>

	<text>The formal calling of Acting President of the Quorum has been held six times by five men: Rudger Clawson , Joseph Fielding Smith , Spencer W. Kimball , Howard W. Hunter and Boyd K. Packer . Additionally, two earlier apostles Orson Hyde and Brigham Young, Jr. have acted as President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles when they were not the second-most senior apostle in the church, and therefore may be said to have played the role of an Acting President of the Quorum before this specific title was created by the church. To date, every former Acting President of the Quorum has eventually gone on to serve as the President of the Quorum.</text>

	<text>Orson Hyde ( 27 December 1847 22 June 1868 ) : When senior Apostle Brigham Young was made President of the Church on 27 December 1847, the next senior Apostle, Heber C. Kimball , was asked by Young to be one of the counselors in the First Presidency . This left Orson Hyde as the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve. According to current practices of the Church, Kimball should have been called as President of the Quorum and Hyde as Acting President. However, this procedure was not followed, and Hyde was simply called as President of the Quorum. This created a historical anomaly whereby Hyde served as the President of the Quorum (not Acting President) while being the third most senior Apostl until Kimball&apos;s death on 22 June 1868 .</text>

	<text>In general, the position of Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is only filled when the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is called as a counselor in the First Presidency of the church. In such instances, the man who holds this calling is the most senior apostle who is not serving in the First Presidency. Additionally, a person may be called as the Acting President of the Quorum when the actual President of the Quorum is unable to perform his duties due to ill health or incapacitation.</text>

	<text>Brigham Young, Jr. ( 9 December 1899 10 October 1901 ) : When Lorenzo Snow became President of the Church, the next senior Apostles, George Q. Cannon and Joseph F. Smith , were asked by Snow to be counselors in the First Presidency . This left Brigham Young, Jr. who was the third most senior Apostle of the Church, but the fourth most senior member of the Quorum as the most senior member of the Quorum of the Twelve. Rather than making Cannon the President of the Quorum, as would be the procedure today, Snow simply asked Young to serve as the President of the Quorum. When Cannon died in April 1901 , Young continued to serve as President of the Quorum, despite the fact that Joseph F. Smith was the second most senior Apostle of the Church. When Snow died later that same year, Smith became President of the Church and Young continued on as President of the Quorum until his own death in 1903 .</text>
