	<text>Eric Owens from mangalife.com enjoys the pace of the story and its high school themes of &quot;love triangles, transfer students, the quiet pretty boy&quot;. It&apos;s much softer and he enjoyed the image of Rei running late with toast in her mouth. The reviewer states that it will appeal to more casual readers rather than Eva fans.</text>

	<text>[ edit ] Other characters Toji Suzuhara Shinji&apos;s classmate, Toji Suzuhara , is one of Shinji&apos;s friends accepted into NERV&apos;s piloting program along with him. He reciprocates Hikari&apos;s crush once she makes her feelings known to him. Much like his anime counterpart, he is shown as the tough jock of the group, and occasionally has verbal bouts with Asuka . However, he does have a much more vulnerable side; while on standby to pilot the Evangelion, he was frightened, but admitted he would risk his life for Hikari&apos;s sake. Kensuke Aida Kensuke Aida is another one of Shinji&apos;s classmates who is accepted into NERV &apos;s piloting program. He has a hobby in camrecording. In this incarnation, he has a crush on Asuka and is usually trying to gain some acknowledgement from her. He later openly states his feelings and then asks if he is &quot;good enough to take Shinji&apos;s place,&quot; causing Asuka to run from him. After an exchange with Asuka while on standby, he realizes that she won&apos;t reciprocate his feelings, and later accepts his role as just a friend to her. Misato Katusragi Misato Katsuragi is the homeroom teacher for Shinji and Asuka&apos;s class. Misato has some operational duties at NERV. Ritsuko Akagi Ritsuko Akagi is the school nurse, and is in love with Gendo Ikari. Ritsuko is also portrayed as the Head Medical and Science officer at NERV. Yui Ikari Yui Ikari , Shinji&apos;s mother, is still alive and working at NERV along with her husband Gendo and Asuka&apos;s parents. Her high school life and relationship with Gendo is chronicled in Volume 5.</text>

	<text>[ edit ] Main characters Shinji Ikari Shinji Ikari is the male protagonist of the series. He is timid, quiet, and easily influenced by his peers. He is very much like his original persona, however he is more sociable and friendly than before. Shinji is also a childhood friend to Asuka Langley Soryu . Asuka Langley Soryu Asuka Langley Soryu is a redhead with fiery temper, and although friends with Shinji she often torments him. Her rage is especially violent in the beginning of the series: she is openly hostile with Kaworu and splashes boiling water on Shinji in a jealous fit during a cooking class. However, she cares deeply for her friends, and will aid or defend them when she is able. She has appointed herself as Shinji&apos;s chaperone and has a clear sense of right and wrong. Although she can be demanding, in truth she doesn&apos;t want to burden anyone or feel useless, especially to her parents or Shinji, similar to the original character&apos;s feeling of inferiority in the anime series. Rei Ayanami Rei Ayanami is an excitable extrovert, the polar opposite of her original persona. However, she is socially inept and clueless as how to perform simple tasks such as cracking an egg open. She is disliked by the girls of her class for &quot;flirting&quot; with boys and wearing her old uniform rather than buying the school&apos;s own regulation clothes. Kaworu Nagisa As in the anime, Kaworu Nagisa has a mysterious past that NERV officials work to uncover. However, despite the lack of official records, Shinji remarks that he and Kaworu have been friends for about a decade, or as long as he has known Asuka. In particular, Kaworu and Shinji often perform music together (Shinji on cello , with Kaworu on violin ). Also, Kaworu has what is termed an unusual &quot;fondness&quot; for Shinji, and sometimes appears to be part of the &quot; love triangle &quot; around him. His appearances in both Shinji and Gendo&apos;s story arcs strongly hints at a deep connection with the Angels.</text>
