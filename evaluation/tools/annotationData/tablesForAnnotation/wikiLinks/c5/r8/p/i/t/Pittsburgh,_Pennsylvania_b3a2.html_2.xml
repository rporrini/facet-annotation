	<text>Pittsburgh has some of the best sports complexes in the country. Heinz Field and PNC Park , both completed in 2001, are ranked state of the art. PNC Park is annually ranked as one of the best if not the best Major League Park, despite the Pirates&apos; perennial losing seasons. The Mellon Arena , home of the Pittsburgh Penguins , introduced the retractable dome to world sporting events when the innovative complex was completed in 1961. It is slated to be replaced in the 2010-11 season after serving its golden anniversary.</text>

	<text>Pittsburgh is the only city where all major sports teams (Steelers, Penguins, and Pirates) share the same two colors, black and gold. The Passion and the Xplosion use these colors as well. Although unofficial, the color scheme is used by the city&apos;s police department, fire department and are the dominant colors on the flag and seal. Many downtown fire hydrants even show the &quot;Pittsburgh colors&quot;.</text>

	<text>Dan Marino , Joe Montana , Joe Namath , Jim Kelly , Marc Bulger , George Blanda , Jeff Hostetler , Johnny Unitas , Bruce Gradkowski , Gus Frerotte , and current Pittsburgh Steelers backup quarterback Charlie Batch are from the area. Several famous running backs, including Tony Dorsett , Curtis Martin , Kevan Barlow , Mercury Morris , Larry Brown , Ernie Davis , Cookie Gilchrist and Joe Marconi are also from Pittsburgh. Several former offensive line greats, including Jim Covert , Russ Grimm , Reggie Wells , and Bill Fralic also hail from the area. Several notable defensive players are from the Pittsburgh area, including Pro Hall of Famers Joe Schmidt and Randy White , defensive end Jason Taylor , cornerback Ty Law and linebacker LaVar Arrington (former Steelers standout Jack Ham was from Johnstown, 65 miles (105 km) from Pittsburgh). Two notable NHL players from the Pittsburgh area include Ryan Malone of the Penguins and R.J. Umberger of the Flyers. There is also a long list of baseball stars such as Ken Griffey, Jr. , Ken Griffey, Sr. , Stan Musial , Honus Wagner , and the claimed hometown of Curt Schilling , as well as numerous Olympic gold medal winners such as wrestler Kurt Angle , Roger Kingdom and John Woodruff and was where Jim Furyk and Arnold Palmer learned to play golf. Pittsburgh also claims many professional sports coaching legends as its own including George Karl , Marvin Lewis , Mike Ditka , Marty Schottenheimer , Mike McCarthy , Bill Cowher , Joe Walton , Barry Alvarez , Chuck Knox , Terry Francona , Chuck Daly , Ken Macha , Dick Nolan , Chuck Tanner and Art Howe . Jim Leyland has made his home in Pittsburgh for the last 25 years. For these reasons, Pittsburgh has been called the &quot;City of Champions.&quot;</text>

	<text>Football is by far the most popular sport in the region, with high school games routinely getting over 10,000 fans per game as well as extensive press coverage. College football is also popular, with fans of Pitt , Penn State , West Virginia , and to a lesser extent, Ohio State and Michigan being popular among the big programs. The NFL&apos;s Pittsburgh Steelers , owned by the Rooney family since the team&apos;s founding in 1933, are by far the most popular sports team in the area and has one of the largest fan bases of any team--amateur or professional--in the United States, if not the world. The team has also been consistently successful since the 1970s when the team won four Super Bowl&apos;s in a six year span as well as winning the team&apos;s fifth championship in 2006. It is often said in recent times that due to the collapse of the steel industry , the Steelers mean more to the city than anything else.</text>

	<text>From the American Civil War to the 1930s, Pittsburgh was a Republican stronghold. Democratic candidates have been elected consecutively to either the mayor&apos;s office or city council since 1933, when David L. Lawrence was able to lead the party to power due to the alleged corruption and fraction of the Pittsburgh Republican Party and the election of President Roosevelt whose New Deal began the recovery from the Great Depression , by which the workers of Pittsburgh were especially hard hit.</text>

	<text>Pittsburgh&apos;s dedication to sports has a long history. Both its professional and collegiate teams have championship records. Three separate colleges have sent their football teams to major bowl games. The Pitt Panthers have won multiple national titles in both football and men&apos;s basketball. As home to two of the most successful teams in the former Negro League , the Pittsburgh Crawfords and the Homestead Grays (credited with as many as 14 titles between them and with 11 hall of famers), as well as the first Major League Baseball team to field an all-black lineup, the 1971 Pittsburgh Pirates , &quot;no city is more synonymous with black baseball than Pittsburgh.&quot;</text>
