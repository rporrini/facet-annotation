	<text>The Northeast-10 name came about when Saint Michael&apos;s College and Quinnipiac College joined the league in 1987, and the conference remained stable until 1995 when Springfield College left for Division III. The league stayed at ten members as Le Moyne College joined the league in 1996 from the New England Collegiate Conference (NECC) and briefly expanded to eleven when Pace University joined in 1998 from the New York Collegiate Athletic Conference (NYCAC). Quinnipiac moved to the Division I Northeast Conference (NEC) to again return the membership to ten, until the last major expansion took place prior to 2000 when five new schools joined the fold. Franklin Pierce College , Southern New Hampshire University (formerly New Hampshire College), the University of Massachusetts Lowell and Southern Connecticut State University were joined by The College of Saint Rose giving the NE-10 15 members. In 2007, Bryant University announced it would begin the five-year process that would make them a full Division I member by 2012; at the same time the NE-10 announced that it had given a bid to University of New Haven and they had accepted. In December 2007 Adelphi University announced it had joined the league and would begin play in 2009-10. To start the 2008-2009 academic year the NE-10 still has its 15 members and will expand to 16 in 2009-10.</text>
