	<text>This wave of Chilean migrants was quite homogeneous, comprised in the majority by skilled workers, and at times, their families. The middle class were represented only in the minority here. Political elitists and intellectuals from the left were also small in numbers, due to their preference for Western Europe and socialist nations in Latin America .</text>

	<text>The third distinguishable wave of immigration to Australia was the greatest in number, and was characterised in large part by those Chileans fleeing their homeland as a consequence of political events following the 1973 military coup.</text>

	<text>His ascension to the presidency provoked a high level of uncertainty amongst the wealthy, given his stated platform of nationalisation of mining, industry, and services. The political and economic unrest that followed prompted many Chileans to flee the threat of political and social instability. This group was, again, overwhelmingly middle class, with sufficient resources (education and finance) to establish themselves as small business operators within Australia. By 1971, 3,760 Chilean-born people were registered in Australia. Current Chilean president Michelle Bachelet briefly lived in Australia with family already present in the country after the Chilean coup of 1973 later moving to East Germany .</text>

	<text>The second significant group to arrive was likely motivated by the presidential election of Salvador Allende in 1970. Allende was the world&apos;s first democratically-elected Marxist President of any nation.</text>

	<text>In the 1960s, especially between the years 1968-70, around 1,500-2,000 Chileans arrived in Australia as a consequence of the economic recession produced during the government of Eduardo Frei Montalva , and the high level of unemployment at the termination of his administration. The majority of these people were middle class and well educated, and their migration can be seen to have an economic basis.</text>

	<text>Chilean people first arrived in great numbers in late 1970s and 1980s. Many came seeking work, skills and education after the economic crisis in Chile. Migration studies demonstrate that late 20th century Chilean migration to Australia occurred in three distinguishable waves.</text>

	<text>Chilean migration to Australia occurred at different times from the late 19th century and throughout the 20th century. The first Labour Party Prime Minister of Australia , Chris Watson , was born in Valpara so , Chile the son of a Chilean citizen of German descent.</text>

	<text>In 1837 two Chileans arrived in Sydney, the first on record in Australia. One was former Chilean President Ram n Freire , exiled from Chile after attempting to re-take power in a coup. He did not settle in Australia, however, but eventually returned to his homeland.</text>
