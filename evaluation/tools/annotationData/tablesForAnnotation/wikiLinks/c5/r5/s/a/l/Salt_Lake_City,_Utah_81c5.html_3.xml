	<text>The Salt Lake Bees are the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim Triple A affiliate that play all home games at Franklin Covey Field . Nearby West Valley City has the Utah Grizzlies ice hockey team of the ECHL . The new ABA league has twice attempted to expand into the city, first with the Utah Snowbears in the 2004-05 season (which folded after reaching the quarterfinals of the playoffs) and later with the Salt Lake Dream (who folded before ever playing a game). The Continental Basketball Association (CBA) also attempted an expansion with the Utah Eagles , who folded halfway through the 2006-07 season. The Utah Starzz of the WNBA were once located within the city, but moved to San Antonio and became the Silver Stars after reaching the playoffs just once and struggling with attendance.</text>

	<text>Utah lacks a professional football team of its own, and college football is very popular in the state. The University of Utah and Brigham Young University both maintain large followings in the city, and rivalries are intense during the annual game between the two universities. This is sometimes referred to as the Holy War because of BYU&apos;s status as an LDS university and despite the fact that Utah is a secular university. The city has also played host to several international soccer games, with the US as the home team (due to the partisan support when playing Latin American teams).</text>

	<text>Most of the ski resorts also offer summer activities. The mountains surrounding Salt Lake City are very popular for hiking , camping , rock climbing , mountain and road biking , and other related outdoor activities. In addition, the many small reservoirs and rivers in the Wasatch Mountains are popular for boating , fishing , and other water-related activities. Salt Lake City is the primary jumping-off point for exploring the national parks and monuments and rugged terrain of the southern half of the state, as it contains the only international airport in the state.</text>

	<text>Winter sports , such as skiing and snowboarding , are popular activities in the Wasatch Mountains east of Salt Lake City. Eight ski resorts lie within 50 miles (80 km) of the city. Alta , Brighton , Solitude Mountain Resort , and Snowbird are located in Big and Little Cottonwood Canyons to the southeast, Deer Valley , The Canyons , and Park City Resort are located to the east, near Park City in Summit County , and Sundance is located to the southeast in Utah County . The ski resorts see frequent storms that deposit light, dry snow due to a phenomenon known as the lake effect , where storms amplified by the warm waters of the Great Salt Lake precipitate in the Wasatch Mountains. Alta and Deer Valley only allow skiing, while the others allow both skiing and snowboarding. The popularity of the ski resorts has increased nearly 29% since the 2002 Winter Olympics .</text>
