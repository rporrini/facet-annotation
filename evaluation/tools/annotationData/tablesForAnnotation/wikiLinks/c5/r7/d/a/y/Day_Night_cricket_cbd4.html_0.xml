	<text>One Day International Day/Night Cricket has been played in England since 2000 however its development in England and Wales has been very limited because until 2005 none of England s One Day Grounds had paramount floodlights and so temporary lights had to be used. The very first One Day International to be played under floodlights in England was on July 6th 2000 between Zimababwe and the West Indies in front of 7,000 people at Gloucestershire s County Ground at Bristol , a match which the West Indies won by six wickets. England played their first home match under lights a week later at Trent Bridge , a match in which they romped to victory against Zimababwe and the match was over at 7.30pm and the lights were barely needed. In 2006 Glamorgan s County Ground in Cardiff staged the first ODI Day/Night match to be played in Wales and also became the first ODI in England and Wales to be played under paramount floodlights. Since 2000 there has never been more than three ODI s played under lights in England and Wales in the same year however in 2009 England will host four day/night ODI&apos;s against Australia which marks the first increase in the number of ODI&apos;s to be played in England under floodlights due to Trent Bridge installing paramount floodlights. As of May 2008 only two of England one day gounds have paramount floodlights, the Rose Bowl and Cardiff however Trent Bridge will become the third in August 2008 and when day/night matches are held away from these grounds temporary lights have to be used.</text>

	<text>As of 2008 only a third of the eighteen first-class counties in the whole of England and Wales have Paramount Floodlights at their home grounds. Because of this the other counties have to use temporary floodlights which are brought in by road when they stage their floodlit macthes at home and because of this (As well as the cost) most, especially the smaller counties only host one floodlit match per year in the NatWest Pro40 League and apart from their home Twenty20 Cup matches it is often seen as the main event of the cricketing season at their grounds with higher than average attendances often recorded depending that the weather is fair.</text>

	<text>In the 2008 Season a total of 55 cricket matches will be played under floodlights in England and Wales, seven in the Friends Provident Trophy , nineteen in the Twenty20 Cup , twenty three in the NatWest Pro40 League and 2 matches in the Twenty20 Floodlit Cup. Also England will play three One Day Internationals under lights at Cardiff , Headingley and at Trent Bridge which will also became the sixth ground in England &amp; Wales to have paramount floodlights and the England Under 19 Team will play one match under lights at Hove and Lord&apos;s will stage its second floodlit match in August.</text>

	<text>In 2006 One Day Cricket in England was given a major revamp by the ECB. This led to quite a few changes for Day/Night Cricket in England. For the first time Day/Night matches were played in the than known C&amp;G Trophy although as in the Twenty20 Cup matches were limited to the counties who owned paramount floodlights who were joined by Hampshire in becoming the fifth county to install paramount floodlights at the Rose Bowl . Also 2006 saw the lunch of the NatWest Pro40 League which replaced the National League however under the new format the counties only played other once in their divisions as opposed to home and away. This meant that the number of day/night matches played in the competition was reduced due to the fact that the counties had fewer home matches to play with. The story stayed the same for 2007 but for one thing. On September 10th 2007, ten years after the first day/night matches were played in England Lord&apos;s finally got to stage its first game under floodlights with a match bewteen Middlesex and Derbyshire , a match which Middlesex won by 4 wickets.</text>

	<text>From 1997 to 2002 Day/Night cricket between the First Class Counties was only played in the Sunday/National League however in 2003 Day/Night Cricket in England and Wales took its next major turn. In May 2003 Essex became the second county to install paramount floodlights at their ground in Chelmsford who until than had staged all of their floodlit matches at Colchester . In June 2003 the Twenty20 Cup kicked off with Essex and Sussex deciding to each play 2 of their home matches under their lights. No other counties staged group matches under lights. This was the first time that Day/Night Cricket in England had been played between any two counties outside of the National League and on July 19th 2003 at Trent Bridge in Nottingham Surrey Lions won not only the Twenty20 Cup for the first time but also won the very first domestic cup final to be decided under floodlights. In 2004 Derbyshire became the third County to install paramount floodlights at their ground in Derby and also the number of day/night games in the Twenty20 Cup in that year increased to 6 matches, up 1 from 2003. Again apart from the final and the three counties who owned paramount floodlights at that time no other county staged matches under lights. In 2005 the Twenty20 Cup expended from 51 matches to 79 matches and this caused another increase in the number of day/night games from six matches to ten. Helped in part by Glamorgan who in the same year became the fourth county to install paramount floodlights at their county ground in Cardiff , once again in 2005 day/night matches in the Twenty20 Cup were limited to the final and the four counties that owned paramount floodlights.</text>

	<text>By 2000 Day/Night Cricket had became a fact of life on the County Cricket scene. In 2000 the First One Day International day/night match in England was played under lights at Bristol and also the England Under 19 team also hosted its first day/night match a few weeks later at Hove . Also Derbyshire , Glamorgan and Northamptonshire staged their first home matches under lights. In 2001 Hampshire and Kent staged their first home day/night matches has did Essex however their first floodlit match was staged at Colchester which as of 2008 is the only out ground in England &amp; Wales to have staged official day/night matches. By 2002 all but one ( Middlesex ) of the first class counties had staged a National League game under lights at their county grounds.</text>

	<text>In 1998 after the success of the previous season seven counties Gloucestershire , Lancashire , Nottinghamshire , Surrey , Sussex , Warwickshire and Yorkshire staged day/night matches with a total of 11 played (up 8 on 1997) under lights, with Warwickshire taking the decision of playing four home matches under lights and Lancahire staging two home matches at Old Trafford, who along with Trent Bridge, Bristol and Headlingley and The Oval who were successful on their second attempt each played one home game under lights for the very first time were the other highlights. By the 1999 season it became official that Day/Night Cricket was here to stay when Sussex became the first county to install paramount floodlights at at their county ground in Hove . Also the advent of the new formed 2 division National League allowed for Day/Night matches to became a major part of the competition. In 1999 more counties came into line with eleven counties staging games including for the first time Durham , Leicestershire , Somerset and Worcestershire who along with the other seven counties who had hosted day/night matches in the previous two seasons played a total of 20 matches, up 8 on 1998.</text>
