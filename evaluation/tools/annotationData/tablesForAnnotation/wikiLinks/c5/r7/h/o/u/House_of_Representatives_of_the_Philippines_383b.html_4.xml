	<text>Because the Constitution of the Philippines sets the number of seats in the lower house at 250 with up to 20% (50 seats) allotted for party-list representatives and 219 district seats are already in place, it is unlikely that proper and equitable reapportionment of districts can be implemented unless constitutional amendments are introduced to either increase the number of available seats in the lower house, increase the population requirement per district, or overhaul the electoral system so that members of the lower house are voted at-large.</text>

	<text>Currently the district with the lowest population is the lone district of Batanes , with only 15,974 inhabitants in 2007. The most populated congressional district, the 2nd District of Quezon City , has 95 times more inhabitants, with a total population of 1,515,455. The most under-represented jurisdiction is the province of Cavite , with only 3 seats out of a possible 11.</text>

	<text>The apportionment of congressional districts is not done regularly by a specially-mandated independent agency, but rather through Republic Acts which are drawn up by members of congress. Apportionment, therefore, is often influenced by political motivations. Incumbent representatives who are not permitted to hold their seats by law after three consecutive terms sometimes resort to dividing their district, or even creating a new province which will be guaranteed a seat, just so that they will be able to run and serve terms in a technically different district. Likewise, politicians whose political fortunes are likely to be jeopardized by any change in district boundaries may delay or even ignore the need for reapportionment.</text>

	<text>In addition, upon becoming a highly-urbanized city in 1995, Mandaluyong was granted its own seat in Congress, leaving the municipality (now city) of San Juan with its own seat despite not meeting the population requirement mainly because in order to meet the threshold and keep the district contiguous, San Juan would have to be redistricted with a part of either Manila or Quezon City because no adjacent city or municipality other than Mandaluyong can be wholly combined with San Juan to form a justifiable single district. To date, the population of San Juan City is still under the 250,000 threshold.</text>

	<text>Since every province is allotted at least one representative in the House of Representatives regardless of population, this results in seats that represent populations that do not meet the 250,000 to 500,000 apportionment criterion. Based on 2007 census figures, there are 15 single-district provinces that have under 250,000 inhabitants: Abra , Apayao , Aurora , Batanes , Biliran , Camiguin , Catanduanes , Dinagat Islands , Guimaras , Ifugao , Kalinga , Marinduque , Mountain Province , Quirino , and Siquijor .</text>
