	<text>If the President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles is asked to become a counselor in the First Presidency , the President of the Quorum retains that title but is not numbered among the Twelve, and the most senior Apostle who is not in the First Presidency is named Acting President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles . The Acting President assumes all of the duties that would normally rest upon the President of the Quorum. The title of Acting President was first used in 1918 for Rudger Clawson . The position has also been used during times of infirmity of a President of the Twelve: for example, Howard W. Hunter was Acting President for the infirm Marion G. Romney from 1985 to 1988 .</text>

	<text>After Taylor died in 1887 , Woodruff did not reorganize the First Presidency until 1889 . But before his death in 1898 , he advised the then then-President of the Twelve, Lorenzo Snow , &quot;Do not wait, Brother Snow, but proceed at once to reorganize the First Presidency.&quot; Snow followed this advice and since then every interval between the death of the President of the Church and the ordination of a new President has been less than two weeks, just long enough to mourn the death of the President of the Church and complete his funeral services, and also for the Quorum of the Twelve to nominate and sustain the President of the Twelve and for the new President to choose his counselors in the First Presidency. When the President of the Twelve becomes the President of the Church, the next Apostle in seniority becomes the new President of the Twelve.</text>

	<text>In 1847 , the Quorum of the Twelve reconstituted the First Presidency, with Brigham Young as President. During Young&apos;s Presidency, seniority within the Quorum of the Twelve was formalized to mean continuous service as an Apostle since being ordained as one of the Twelve . The original apostles of 1835 had been ranked by age, and two of them had been excommunicated and later restored to fellowship. With this rule in place, it was John Taylor who led the Church after Young&apos;s death in 1877 , first as President of the Twelve and after 1880 as President of the Church with Wilford Woodruff as President of the Twelve.</text>

	<text>Upon the death of the President of the Church, the First Presidency automatically dissolves, leaving the Twelve Apostles as the highest leadership body and their President as the highest official in the Church. On the death of Church President Joseph Smith, Jr. in 1844 , this position was held by Brigham Young , and he persuaded the Church that Smith&apos;s death left him and not Sidney Rigdon , who had been Smith&apos;s First Counselor in the First Presidency, as the senior leader. Smith had reportedly taught the Apostles, &quot;Where I am not, there is no First Presidency over the Twelve.&quot;</text>
