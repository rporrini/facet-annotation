	<text>In 2001, while parting ways with Atlantic, Gurewitz was officially back in the band and Bad Religion resigned to Epitaph. As soon as Gurewitz returned, Schayer also left the band and was replaced by current drummer Brooks Wackerman . Now as a six piece, Bad Religion recorded and released the albums The Process of Belief (2002) and The Empire Strikes First (2004). Their most recent release is New Maps of Hell (2007).</text>

	<text>Gurewitz was replaced by Brian Baker during the Stranger Than Fiction tour. During Gurewitz&apos;s departure, Bad Religion declined in popularity and released The Gray Race (1996) and No Substance (1998) to poor reviews. In 1999, after a five year hiatus from the band, Gurewitz reunited with Graffin and co-wrote the song &quot;Believe It&quot;, which appeared on Bad Religion&apos;s 11th album The New America , which was released in 2000.</text>

	<text>Bad Religion rose to fame with their next album, 1994&apos;s Stranger Than Fiction , including their well-known hits &quot; Infected &quot; and &quot; 21st Century (Digital Boy) &quot; (which was originally recorded on Against the Grain ), which are also often considered concert staples. To date, Stranger Than Fiction remains another one of Bad Religion&apos;s best known albums, with sales continuing thirteen years after its release. After the album was completed, Gurewitz soon left Bad Religion to concentrate on the future of Epitaph, citing the increasing amount of time he was spending at Epitaph&apos;s offices as The Offspring became one of the biggest bands of the mid-1990s, but it was well known that his departure was not on good terms.</text>

	<text>With Bobby Schayer as Finestone&apos;s replacement, Bad Religion&apos;s music would take a different direction on their next album, Generator (1992). For the album, Bad Religion also filmed their first music video &quot; Atomic Garden &quot;, which was also their first song to be released as a single. Around 1993, Bad Religion parted ways with Epitaph and signed to Atlantic Records , who released their next album, Recipe for Hate , in the same year. While moderately successful, this was the first Bad Religion album to reach any Billboard charts and two videos for the album, &quot; American Jesus &quot; and &quot; Struck a Nerve &quot;, were made.</text>

	<text>Bad Religion underwent several line-up changes before the 1986 reunion of the How Could Hell Be Any Worse? line-up (including Hetson). Two years later, the now-classic reunion line-up recorded their highly acclaimed album Suffer . album was a comeback for Bad Religion as well as a watershed for the Southern California punk sound popularized by their label Epitaph. This album also became the Epitaph&apos;s best seller and was the label&apos;s best-selling album for a number of years, until the 1994 release of The Offspring&apos;s Smash . Bad Religion recorded and released two more albums, No Control (1989) and Against the Grain (1990), before Finestone quit the group once again in early 1991.</text>

	<text>After the release of Into the Unknown , Bad Religion broke up, but reformed (without Gurewitz) to produce the 1984 EP Back to the Known . The EP features the return of the band&apos;s punk rock roots, although also reflecting influences of then current acts such as H sker D and The Descendents . Soon after, Bad Religion went on hiatus again.</text>

	<text>Bad Religion released their second full-length, Into the Unknown , in 1983, but were less successful, due to the album&apos;s poor production and a major change from their previous style, delving into progressive rock heavy in keyboards. While recording one song, Bentley and Finestone left the band and were replaced by Paul Dedona on bass and Davy Goldman on drums. To date, Into the Unknown remains out of print, after almost all of the 10,000 copies were surreptitiously sold out of the warehouse they were being stored in by Suzy Shaw, an ex-girlfriend of Gurewitz.</text>

	<text>Bad Religion were formed in 1980 by Greg Graffin (vocals), Brett Gurewitz (guitar), Jay Bentley (bass) and Jay Ziskrout (drums). The line-up, at the time, recorded and released a six-song self-titled EP in 1981 on Epitaph Records (a label founded by Gurewitz). The EP was originally released in a 7&quot; format, and soon afterward re-issued as a 12&quot;. Compact cassettes were also produced, but they are rare. Bad Religion&apos;s first full-length album, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? , was released in 1982. When recording sessions commenced, Ziskrout soon left the band and was replaced by Pete Finestone . Cited as one of Bad Religion&apos;s most important works, How Could Hell Be Any Worse? was financed by a $1,000 loan from Gurewitz&apos;s father. Its success surprised the band when it sold 10,000 copies in under a year. The sound of the record was vastly improved from the self-titled EP. Although not yet credited as a member of the band, Greg Hetson (of Circle Jerks fame) did a guitar solo on &quot;Part III&quot;.</text>
