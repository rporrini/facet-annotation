He went into exile or self-exile to the court of Kaykaus in Iconium . He was recalled in 1258 and appointed Megas Kontostaulos , chief of the Frankish mercenaries . He used his position to assassinate George Mouzalon, Regent for John IV, and claim the regency for himself. He served two years as co-emperor prior to Alexios Strategopoulos capturing Constanntinople in his name. Michael transferred his capital to the captured city and shortly after deposed his co-emperor.

	<text>He was a member of the Komnenos family who had risen to prominence in the reign of Basil II. He contacted a civil war against Michael VI, supported by his fellow members of the military aristocracy. He managed to force his opponent to abdication by the end of the summer. He rewarded his noble partisans with appointments which granted them authority but kept them at a distance from Constantinople. Attempted to repair the depleted finances of the empire by revoking numerous pensions and grants conferred by his predecessors and appropriating revenues from the wealthy monasteries. His only campaign was a defensive expedition against Andrew I of Hungary which threatened the northern borders of the empire. The campaign was successful and led to a peace treaty with the Kingdom of Hungary . He abdicated while convinced he was suffering from a fatal disease. Actually recoved shortly after his abdication. Spend the remainder of his life as a monk and scholar in the Monastery of Stoudios .</text>
