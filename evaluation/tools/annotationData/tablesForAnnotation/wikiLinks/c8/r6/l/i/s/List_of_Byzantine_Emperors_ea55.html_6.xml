	<text>A minor soldier in the Roman army, he led a rebellion against Maurice after the latter ordered the exhausted forces to winter on the unprotected side of the Danube, and then tried to send them on a winter campaign. In the ensuing rebellion, Maurice abdicated; Phocas had himself crowned Emperor, and then executed the ex-emperor and his children. He was initially popular due to his lowering of taxes and his reforms. However, under his rule, the traditional Roman borders in the east began to collapse, whilst the Persians supported rebellions on their border and advanced their control westwards. Eventually, his authority crumbled, and Heraclius proclaimed himself as Emperor and seized control, executing Phocas.</text>
