	<text>In September 1991, the swordfishing boat Andrea Gail returns to home port in Gloucester, Massachusetts with a poor catch. Desperate for money, the captain convinces his reluctant crew to join him for one more fishing expedition. They head out past their usual fishing grounds, leaving a developing storm behind them. They find great success at the Flemish Cap , but when their ice machine breaks, the only way to preserve their catch is to hurry back home. However, between the Andrea Gail and Gloucester is a confluence of two powerful weather fronts and a hurricane . The crew struggles to sail through pounding waves and shrieking winds, while friends and family worry and wait for a ship that never comes home.</text>

	<text>The district court held that the defendants&apos; First Amendment right to freedom of speech barred the suit. The plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit , which could not decide how to interpret the Florida law at issue and certified the question to the Florida Supreme Court . On April 21 , 2005 , the Florida Supreme Court upheld the district court&apos;s interpretation of Florida law and remanded the case to the 11th Circuit, which then affirmed the district court&apos;s original decision to dismiss the case.</text>
