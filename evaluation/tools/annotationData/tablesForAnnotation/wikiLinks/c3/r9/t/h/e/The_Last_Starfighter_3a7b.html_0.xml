	<text>Wil Wheaton , known for his portrayal of Wesley Crusher in Star Trek: The Next Generation , had a part in the movie, but his scenes were cut. However, his name still appears in the closing credits and he can be seen as the tallest child running through the trailer park in one of the earliest scenes. Marc Alaimo , who played Gul Dukat in Star Trek: Deep Space Nine , also appears as one of the assassins in human disguise sent to Earth to kill Alex Rogan by Xur (before the disguise is &quot;detected&quot; and erased by a nearby Last Starfighter game). Meg Wyllie who played the Keeper in the Star Trek pilot The Cage appears briefly as Granny.</text>

	<text>Alex returns to Earth, dramatically landing his Gunstar in the trailer park. After explaining to his friends and family where he was, Alex reveals that his services as a Starfighter are still needed by the Rylan Star League. He then asks Maggie to join him in space...as his wife. Maggie&apos;s grandmother, Granny Gordon ( Meg Wyllie ) gives her blessing to her granddaughter, and returns to Rylos with him.</text>

	<text>At the victory celebration, Centauri reappears; he was never actually dead, but rather in a coma-like healing trance. Alex is proclaimed the Savior of Rylos, only to discover from Enduran (who escaped from the Starfighter base before its destruction) that the Star League is still vulnerable: The Frontier has collapsed and Xur still lives. Alex agrees to stay and recruit other Starfighters, rebuilding the Legion.</text>

	<text>Alex and Grig attack the Kodan mother-ship, crippling its communications system; now they can catch the Kodan fighter wings off-guard. The battle reaches a fevered pitch; Alex keeps the upper hand, using the &quot;lone fighter-against-hordes&quot; tactics he mastered by playing the coin-operated videogame. Soon, however, his weapons are depleted. Desperately, he activates a secret weapon installed by Grig: Death Blossom, which destroys all the remaining Kodan fighters. Lord Kril (Dan Mason), captain of the Kodan mother-ship, blames Xur for this turn of events. After relieving Xur of command, Kril orders him executed. Instead, Xur kills the sentries escorting him from the bridge. He then flees the mother-ship just before Alex opens fire and knocks out its helm/navigation system. Kril and his fellow Kodans perish as their mother-ship crashes into the nearby moon of Galon and explodes.</text>

	<text>Meanwhile, on Earth, Beta is having a difficult time replacing Alex. He fails at Alex&apos;s job as a repairman, ruins Alex&apos;s relationship with Maggie, and is nearly discovered by Alex&apos;s oversexed younger brother Louis ( Chris Hebert )...who collects Playboy magazines. Beta finally admits to Maggie that he is not the real Alex Rogan, that Alex is in fact engaging Xur&apos;s forces as a Starfighter. Maggie doesn&apos;t believe him at first, but when he is shot by the Zandozan and his damaged circuity is exposed, she realizes the truth. The assassin tries to alert Xur, but Beta kills it first...at the cost of his own life when he crashes Alex&apos;s truck into the Zandozan&apos;s ship. As the wreckage of the ship and the truck burn before her eyes, Maggie looks skyward and proclaims her love for Alex. Meanwhile, Xur, who only received part of the Zandozan&apos;s communique wrongly assumes Alex is dead and proceeds with his invasion of Rylos.</text>

	<text>Alex agrees to return and finds the Starfighter base in ruins. Centauri dies from his wounds just after landing, leaving Alex alone with his friend Grig. After getting Alex suited up, Grig places him in the gunnery chair of the Starfighters&apos; designated space warcraft, the &quot;Gunstar.&quot; Grig serves as navigator while Alex mans the weapons systems. Alex is delighted to find that the controls are just like those of the arcade game, but is horrified to learn that all the other Starfighters have been destroyed in Xur&apos;s ambush; he and Grig will have to battle the Kodan Armada by themselves. His brief desire to be taken home again is overcome, however, when Grig points out that Xur&apos;s plans of conquest would ultimately expand towards Earth.</text>

	<text>Alex&apos;s life is saved by two eerie twists of fate. First, in his shock from said revelation, he declines to participate in the Xurian War. So Centauri brings him back to Earth and gives him a high-tech pager to use, should Alex change his mind. Unbeknownst to either Centauri or Alex, Xur shows up in the Kodan mother-ship shortly after their departure. After breaching The Frontier, an array of planetary-scale force fields that protect Rylos and its surroundings galactic territories from invasion, he all but destroys the Starfighter base with the mother-ship&apos;s &quot;meteor gun&quot; (a keel-mounted mass driver ), killing most of the base personnel (excluding Grig) and all of the Starfighters save the one who just left: Alex. Back at home, Alex discovers that he has not been missed because Centauri replaced him with an android named Beta (Lance Guest in a dual role). Beta, an exact replica of Alex, seconds the urging of Centauri: that Alex should serve Rylos, and the galaxy, as a Starfighter. It doesn&apos;t help that Beta has made bad impressions on many of Alex&apos;s friends and family members, including his girlfriend Maggie Gordon ( Catherine Mary Stewart ). Angered, Alex activates the pager so that Centauri can remove the impostor. No sooner has he done so, however, than a Zandozan (Xurian assassin ) appears. It tries to kill both Alex and Beta (because it cannot tell them apart). Centauri arrives during the chase that ensues; he kills the Zandozan but is seriously wounded in the process. Centauri warns Alex that he has been discovered by the enemy, that more Zandozans are on the way; therefore, his only hope of survival is to become a Starfighter.</text>

	<text>Alex is taken to the briefing area and meets a fellow compatriot: Star-navigator Grig ( Dan O&apos;Herlihy ), a jovial sauropod alien. When confronting Centauri, Alex learns that the Starfighter game is in fact a test devised to find those &quot;with the gift.&quot; Furthermore, the game&apos;s story about defending the galaxy against enemies is real, with a full-blown Starfighter battle preparing to be launched. Xur appears(via a holographic projection)inside of the Starfighter base and reveals he has discovered an infiltrator in his ranks and proceeds to broadcast his death by torture to the entire base, including his father, Ambassador Enduran ( Kay E. Kuter ), the Starfighter commander. He then proclaims to the people of Rylos that once Galon(Rylos&apos; moon)is in full eclipse, the Kodan Armada will begin their invasion and not even the Starfighters will be able to save them. Undaunted by his son&apos;s declaration, Enduran defiantly replies, We shall see, Xur. We shall see!</text>

	<text>The Last Starfighter is one of the earliest films to make extensive use of computer graphics for its special effects . In place of physical models, 3D rendered models were used to depict space ships and many other objects. The Gunstar and other spaceships were the design of artist Ron Cobb , who also worked on Alien , Star Wars and Conan the Barbarian .</text>

	<text>Upon his arrival, Alex is given a flight suit. He is also fitted with a translator so he can understand the various alien languages of the League&apos;s alien members. Alex discovers that he has been recruited as a starship weapons-expert. He also discovers that the images and territories in the Starfighter arcade game represent a conflict which actually is raging between the Rylan Star League and the Kodan Empire; the latter is led by Xur ( Norman Snow ), a psychopathic rebel to whom the Kodan Emperor has promised (with no intention of delivering) control of Rylos itself.</text>
