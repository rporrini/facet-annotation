	<text>Hemp is the common name for cannabis and the name most used (in English) when this annual herb is grown for non-drug purposes . These include the industrial purposes for which cultivation licences may be issued in the European Union (EU) . When grown for industrial purposes hemp is often called industrial hemp , and a common product is fibre for use in a variety of different ways. Fuel is often a by-product of hemp cultivation.</text>

	<text>Hemp may be grown also for food (the seed) but in the UK at least (and probably in other EU countries) cultivation licences are not available for this purpose. Within Defra (the UK&apos;s Department for the Environment, Food and the Rural Affairs) hemp is treated as purely a non-food crop , despite the fact that seed can and does appear on the UK market as a perfectly legal food product.</text>
