	<text>Easterbook&apos;s column has been highly critical of Bill Belichick with relation to the &quot;Spygate&quot; controversy, calling for Belichick&apos;s permanent banning from the league. Easterbrook&apos;s response to Spygate was subtly criticized by his fellow &quot;Page Two&quot; columnist and New England Patriots fan Bill Simmons. http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=simmons/080522 &quot;If you have a national column in which you&apos;re excoriating a sports team for cheating even though it already paid a severe penalty for what it did, and you&apos;re hinting more revelations are coming down the road, and then it&apos;s proven you were barking up the wrong tree ... you need to admit defeat and quit blowing the situation out of proportion.

	<text>According to Easterbrook, the &quot;longest [named] award in sports&quot;. This is the top award in a series of awards he publishes at the end of each season, known as the &quot;All-Unwanted All-Pros.&quot; These awards were created due to Easterbrook&apos;s view that the awards and Pro-Bowl selection of various sports media outlets and the NFL tended to unfairly reward what he considered &quot;glory boy&quot; positions, such as quarterbacks, running backs and wide receivers, as well as players who tended to be more well known due to higher press coverage as opposed to actual quality of play. Easterbrook also was protesting the lack of attention given to offensive or defensive linemen whom he considers the most important positions in football. Criteria tend to vary from year to year but generally includes players who either were undrafted or cut from previous teams, but otherwise managed to play important or pivotal roles with their current teams over the course of the season.</text>
