	<text>Richard Stokes produces Torchwood . Originally, Doctor Who director James Hawes was lined up as producer. After directing the BBC Four drama The Chatterley Affair , Hawes backed out of the project. Davies told Doctor Who Magazine that Hawes &quot;has been having such a good time... that he&apos;s decided directing is his greatest passion, and as a result, he&apos;s stepped down.&quot;</text>

	<text>Torchwood , unlike its parent programme, centres on a team instead of a single character and companion(s). The show is oriented on Torchwood Three, the Cardiff branch of the Torchwood Institute, tasked (among other things) with keeping an eye on the space/time Rift that runs through the city, and on whatever washes through it. Torchwood Three is a team of five operatives, led by Jack Harkness ( John Barrowman ), with Gwen Cooper ( Eve Myles ) as the &quot;new girl&quot; who joins up in the first episode and acts as a point-of-view character for the viewer. Aside from the team, one recurring character is Rhys Williams ( Kai Owen ), Gwen&apos;s live-in boyfriend and later husband, who is initially unaware of the nature of Gwen&apos;s mysterious new job. Also regularly recurring is PC Andy Davidson ( Tom Price ), Gwen&apos;s former police partner and occasional comic relief .</text>
