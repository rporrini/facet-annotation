	<text>Finally, the relatively small cast has led to many romantic pairings and love triangles involving family members and in-laws. Some of the most controversial ones have been the romantic attraction shared between Ridge and his former half-sister/stepdaughter Bridget, as well as the recent attraction shared by Rick and his much younger step-niece Phoebe. Though the characters were not biologically related, this had not been established on the show until the 2002 reveal of Massimo being Ridge&apos;s biological father. Additionally, many of the show&apos;s storylines have featured siblings or a parent/child in love with and/or competing for the affections of the same character. The character of Brooke has been famously married to several members of the same family: Besides once being married to Nick, she has also had a long-running romance with Nick&apos;s half-brother Ridge, which has led to several marriages and a child. She was also previously married to Ridge&apos;s half-brother Thorne and Thorne&apos;s father Eric, with whom she also has two children. Finally, she had an affair with her daughter Bridget&apos;s husband Deacon, which resulted in yet another child. Notably, Nick was also recently married to Bridget for a while. A saving point for many viewers with respect to Brooke&apos;s romantic pairings has been Katherine Kelly Lang&apos;s notable chemistry with most of her male co-stars.</text>

	<text>Recasting is also a controversial, yet ongoing, fixture on the show. In the show&apos;s 20 year history, many characters have been played by two or more actors, often leading to a viewer backlash. One such instance was the 2004 recast of Bridget Forrester from Emmy-winner Jennifer Finnigan to relative newcomer Emily Harrison . Viewers did not adjust well to the new Bridget and Harrison was soon downgraded to recurring status . The mistake was rectified later that year when former The Young and the Restless star Ashley Jones stepped into the role. Jones has consistently remained with the show since. B&amp;B has also had many other successful recasts, such as Winsor Harmon &apos;s Thorne Forrester , Lesli Kay &apos;s Felicia Forrester and Patrick Duffy &apos;s Stephen Logan . The recast of Rick Forrester from Emmy-winning Justin Torkildsen to ex- Days of our Lives star Kyle Lowder in 2007 met a mixed reaction from fans. It was announced in July 2007 that three-time Emmy winner Heather Tom , famous for portraying Victoria Newman on Y&amp;R from 1991 to 2003 , would join the cast of B&amp;B as Katie , the younger sister of Brooke and Donna Logan , a role previously played by Nancy Sloan. Tom first aired on August 30 , 2007 . In December 2007 , Tom, who had only signed a three-month deal initially, renewed her contract through 2011 .</text>

	<text>The show has also been criticized for the sometimes breakneck speed in which it changes storylines, in particular with changes in romantic pairings. It is important to note that although the show is sometimes criticized for rapid changes, several leading soap critics, including Carolyn Hinsey, have lauded the show for knowing when a story isn&apos;t working, and changing or ending the story as a result (such as the 2005 romantic story involving Bridget and Ridge). It is, however, disconcerting that storylines are sometimes dropped without any kind of resolution.</text>
