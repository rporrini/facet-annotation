	<text>Hird was a committed Christian , hosting the religious programme &apos;Praise Be!&apos;, a spin-off from Songs of Praise on the BBC . Her work for charity and on television in spite of old age and ill health made her an institution. Her advertisements for Churchill stairlifts (often misidentified as Stannah) also maintained her in the public eye.</text>

	<text>Her first ever appearance on stage was when she was two months old in a play her father was managing. Her family background was largely theatrical: her mother, Marie Mayor, had been an actress, while her father managed a number of entertainment venues in Morecambe, to include the Royalty Theatre where she made her first appearance, and the Central Pier. Thora often described her father as her sternest critic and attributed much of her talent as an actress and comedienne to his guidance. Although Thora left Morecambe in the late 1940s, she retained her affection for the town, referring to herself as a &quot;sand grown&apos;un&quot;, the colloquial term for anyone born in Morecambe.</text>
