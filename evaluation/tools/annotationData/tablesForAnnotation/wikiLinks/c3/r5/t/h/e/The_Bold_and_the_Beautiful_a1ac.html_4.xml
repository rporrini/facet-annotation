	<text>Finally, the relatively small cast has led to many romantic pairings and love triangles involving family members and in-laws. Some of the most controversial ones have been the romantic attraction shared between Ridge and his former half-sister/stepdaughter Bridget, as well as the recent attraction shared by Rick and his much younger step-niece Phoebe. Though the characters were not biologically related, this had not been established on the show until the 2002 reveal of Massimo being Ridge&apos;s biological father. Additionally, many of the show&apos;s storylines have featured siblings or a parent/child in love with and/or competing for the affections of the same character. The character of Brooke has been famously married to several members of the same family: Besides once being married to Nick, she has also had a long-running romance with Nick&apos;s half-brother Ridge, which has led to several marriages and a child. She was also previously married to Ridge&apos;s half-brother Thorne and Thorne&apos;s father Eric, with whom she also has two children. Finally, she had an affair with her daughter Bridget&apos;s husband Deacon, which resulted in yet another child. Notably, Nick was also recently married to Bridget for a while. A saving point for many viewers with respect to Brooke&apos;s romantic pairings has been Katherine Kelly Lang&apos;s notable chemistry with most of her male co-stars.</text>

	<text>The Bold And The Beautiful : Sheila Carter ( Kimberlin Brown ) was the first major character to cross over to The Bold And The Beautiful . Sheila appeared on Young and the Restless from 1990-1992 (returning as a guest in 1993, 1994 and 1995), and again in 2005-2006. She was on The Bold And The Beautiful from 1992-1998, with shorter-lived stints in 2002 and 2003.</text>

	<text>Recasting is also a controversial, yet ongoing, fixture on the show. In the show&apos;s 20 year history, many characters have been played by two or more actors, often leading to a viewer backlash. One such instance was the 2004 recast of Bridget Forrester from Emmy-winner Jennifer Finnigan to relative newcomer Emily Harrison . Viewers did not adjust well to the new Bridget and Harrison was soon downgraded to recurring status . The mistake was rectified later that year when former The Young and the Restless star Ashley Jones stepped into the role. Jones has consistently remained with the show since. B&amp;B has also had many other successful recasts, such as Winsor Harmon &apos;s Thorne Forrester , Lesli Kay &apos;s Felicia Forrester and Patrick Duffy &apos;s Stephen Logan . The recast of Rick Forrester from Emmy-winning Justin Torkildsen to ex- Days of our Lives star Kyle Lowder in 2007 met a mixed reaction from fans. It was announced in July 2007 that three-time Emmy winner Heather Tom , famous for portraying Victoria Newman on Y&amp;R from 1991 to 2003 , would join the cast of B&amp;B as Katie , the younger sister of Brooke and Donna Logan , a role previously played by Nancy Sloan. Tom first aired on August 30 , 2007 . In December 2007 , Tom, who had only signed a three-month deal initially, renewed her contract through 2011 .</text>
