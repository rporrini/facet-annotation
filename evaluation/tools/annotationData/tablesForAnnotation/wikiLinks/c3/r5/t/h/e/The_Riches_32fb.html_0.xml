He is a consummate, intelligent grifter and thief who experienced an ' existential crisis ' while his wife was serving time in prison.

He seems to be an almost pathological liar and appears to get a kind of high from escalating deception.

	<text>As the series begins Dahlia has just been paroled from prison. During her two-year sentence, she has developed various drug addictions. In her absence, Wayne and the children have been continuing to act as con artists across the US. After a brief reunion with their Traveller clan, the family flees to avoid an arranged marriage for Di Di. Wayne steals a large amount of money from the clan&apos;s hoard of cash, and the family runs off. After getting into an altercation and RV chase with another Traveller family, the Malloys are involved in a car accident that kills a very wealthy couple (the eponymous Riches). Choosing not to return to their clan camp and to pursue a &quot;better life&quot;, they instead adopt the Riches&apos; identity in an affluent gated community in Baton Rouge, Louisiana . They struggle to adjust to their new lives as buffers , as they call non-Travellers, while attempting to avoid their deception from being exposed by characters from both their past and the Riches&apos;.</text>
