He is a consummate, intelligent grifter and thief who experienced an ' existential crisis ' while his wife was serving time in prison. He has become disillusioned with the nomadic , scamming lifestyle of the Travellers; it was his idea to steal the identities of deceased Doug and Cherien Rich and settle down into a normal life. Dahlia has referred to him as a 'halfbreed' or 'half buffer'. He is revealed to be Irish, and to have lived in an orphanage before the travelers took him in.</td>]]></html>

A recovering methamphetamine addict, we've seen Dahlia take a wide array of legal and illegal drugs since her parole, but recently she appears to be trying to get clean. Dahlia is considered 'royalty' in their Traveller clan, and her connection to the clan (both by blood and ideology) appears to be much stronger than Wayne's. She was initially very skeptical of Wayne's plan to leave their old lifestyle and impersonate the Riches, but has helped him work the con and done her part to assume the identity of Cherien Rich. Out of guilt over her current lifestyle, Dahlia has recently turned herself in for parole violation.</td>]]></html>

In the opening scene of the pilot she is seen pickpocketing people at a high school class reunion while Wayne distracts them. On Dahlia's first night out of prison, Di Di is the one who finds her mother passed out, cough syrup bottle in hand, with needle marks showing on her arm. Di Di's relationship with her mother appears to be strained; when it temporarily seemed the family would split up, Di Di chose to stay with her father (Wayne). As of episode 3, she has struck up a relationship with classmate and Edenfalls local Erick (see: The Rosemere Academy ). Like her father, she is more open to the lifestyle they have found assuming the identity of the Rich family. Unlike most her family however, as the series progressed, she has become more positive at the opportunities a normal life can bring in comparison to her previous nomadic traveler lifestyle.</td>]]></html>
