	<text>Dancing with the Deals was Deal or No Deal&apos;s first attempt at a celebrity special series (and was highly successful). Celebrities that were featured came from the entertainment show Dancing With the Stars , which is broadcast on the same network as Deal or No Deal. The specials consist of the celebrity playing the game for a home viewer, and the home viewer, who is randomly picked out of all who registered, will win the prize rather than the celebrity (similar to Double Deal Friday . The following tables show who the celebrities were, the date they appeared on, and how much they won.</text>

	<text>Starting August 31 , 2004 , Deal or No Deal: $12 Million Month marked the introduction of the Supercase and Chance features. It also held several hour-long prime time specials such as the Psychics Special, Conflict of the Couples and Unluckiest Players. This was due to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games which replaced Deal Or No Deal in August.</text>

	<text>Deal or No Deal - Double Shot is a series of specials where the podium will contain two briefcases with $200,000 inside them instead of one giving the contestant a 1 in 13 chance of selecting the top prize. The additional $200,000 is in replacement of the 50c amount. These set of episodes have said to answer to the premiere of Million Dollar Wheel of Fortune on the Nine Network , which will air at the same time as Deal or No Deal (except in Queensland when Wheel will air at 5pm due to Extra airing at 5:30pm). A similar special aired in 2004, with two $200,000 cases, however the second $200,000 case replaced the $1,500 amount rather than the 50c. Also, for the podium players, should a contestant guess that there&apos;s $200,000 in their case, they must specify whether it&apos;s the actual $200,000, or the &quot;Double Shot&quot; $200,000 to prevent them from having a 2 in any chance of winning $500. In the 10 episodes aired, the total amount of money won to the contestants was $235,100 but unsurprisingly both $200,000 cases did not get selected at all. Two contestants walked away with $50,000, another with $41,000 and one contestant turned $20 into $35,000.</text>

	<text>Andrew O&apos;Keefe appeared as himself in the Australian comedy Kath &amp; Kim , reprising his role as host of Deal or No Deal . Character Sharon Strzelecki (portrayed by Magda Szubanski ) appeared as the main contestant and Kim Craig ( Gina Riley ) appeared as the podium player. Sharon wins the $20,000 directly from her case (though the footage of her winnings was never shown). Several changes are made to the fictional gameplay compared to the real life gameplay, as Kim was never given an opportunity to make a guess for her case, and Sharon claims in the episode that she became the contestant by having the &quot;fastest fingers&quot; (the preliminary quiz was dropped from the 2007 season, and the fictional game shown was clearly the 2007 version). References to the real life version are made, as Andrew tells the girls that it&apos;s &quot; almost news time &quot;, as the real life show is broadcast before the news.</text>
