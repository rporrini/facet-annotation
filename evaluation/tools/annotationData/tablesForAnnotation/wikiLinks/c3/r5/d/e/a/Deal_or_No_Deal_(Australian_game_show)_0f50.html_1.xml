	<text>Dancing with the Deals was Deal or No Deal&apos;s first attempt at a celebrity special series (and was highly successful). Celebrities that were featured came from the entertainment show Dancing With the Stars , which is broadcast on the same network as Deal or No Deal. The specials consist of the celebrity playing the game for a home viewer, and the home viewer, who is randomly picked out of all who registered, will win the prize rather than the celebrity (similar to Double Deal Friday . The following tables show who the celebrities were, the date they appeared on, and how much they won.</text>

	<text>Starting August 31 , 2004 , Deal or No Deal: $12 Million Month marked the introduction of the Supercase and Chance features. It also held several hour-long prime time specials such as the Psychics Special, Conflict of the Couples and Unluckiest Players. This was due to the 2004 Athens Olympic Games which replaced Deal Or No Deal in August.</text>

	<text>Andrew O&apos;Keefe appeared as himself in the Australian comedy Kath &amp; Kim , reprising his role as host of Deal or No Deal . Character Sharon Strzelecki (portrayed by Magda Szubanski ) appeared as the main contestant and Kim Craig ( Gina Riley ) appeared as the podium player. Sharon wins the $20,000 directly from her case (though the footage of her winnings was never shown). Several changes are made to the fictional gameplay compared to the real life gameplay, as Kim was never given an opportunity to make a guess for her case, and Sharon claims in the episode that she became the contestant by having the &quot;fastest fingers&quot; (the preliminary quiz was dropped from the 2007 season, and the fictional game shown was clearly the 2007 version). References to the real life version are made, as Andrew tells the girls that it&apos;s &quot; almost news time &quot;, as the real life show is broadcast before the news.</text>

	<text>Many alterations to the game have been made throughout the years, mainly to entice viewers against the game show rivals, including the briefcase values (see below), and the addition of many new gameplay features (see Features ). During the 2004 $12 Million Month , the Supercase , Chance and Megaguess features were introduced for the first time, and have become recurring segments ever since. In 2005, a car was introduced as a prize (replacing the $25,000 amount on the 2004 amount board). The cars have been the Renault M gane II ), valued at $33,000, in 2005, and the Peugeot 307 from 2006 onwards, valued at $30,000 approximately. In 2006, Double or Nothing was introduced to the show. Since the 2007 season, the game&apos;s format has remained the same. The only changes in the 2007 and 2008 seasons were the logo change, which occurred in 2007, the removal of the preliminary quiz (which determined who would be the main contestant) and onscreen graphics and music have been updated several times. Double Deal Friday was dropped in 2008 for a Daily Prize Feature.</text>
