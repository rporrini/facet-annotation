	<text>The universe of Commander in Chief shares a great deal of recent history with that of the real world: in the first episode, Vice Presidents Al Gore and Dick Cheney are mentioned, suggesting that the show&apos;s universe took place sometime in the near future. As the first episode states that Teddy Bridges served four years as Vice President and the show begins two years into his first Presidential term, some viewers assume that, in the universe of the series, either President George W. Bush served only one term (2001-2005) or that Teddy Bridges was his Vice President for the second term (2005-2009). This would place Bridges&apos; election to the Presidency in 2008 and the show around the year 2011 . It is also possible that the show takes place more than a decade from now. However, in the episode First Dance , Russia is described as having been a democracy for only 15 years, placing the first season around 2006 , assuming a parallel unfolding of history. Another possibility is that the writers have simply disregarded statements made in the first few episodes and now retconned the series to take place in the present (in an alternate timeline).</text>

	<text>On May 13, 2006, ABC announced that the show had been cancelled, although the remaining three episodes of the season were broadcast after the ratings year had ended. The network is in discussions with Rod Lurie, the creator of the show, about making a television movie based on the television show. On June 30 , 2006 , Davis told The Stage that the telemovie had been confirmed. [1] .</text>

	<text>The series was created by American director Rod Lurie , director of the films The Contender and Deterrence , and may have been inspired by The West Wing , a popular political drama on rival NBC .</text>

	<text>The placement of the series within the federal election cycle is also in question. Although early episodes refer to Bridges&apos; death occurring prior to the midterm elections, later episodes e.g. The Mom Who Came To Dinner refer to two years remaining in the Presidential term. This is inconsistent with First Strike , which places Bridges&apos; death months after the midterm elections. As the series&apos; episodes have paralleled their actual air dates, including events such as the Atlantic hurricane season, Halloween, and Thanksgiving, it would make sense that Bridges&apos; death occurred during his third year in office, which would mean a Presidential election due shortly thereafter.</text>

	<text>The show was #1 on Tuesday nights until FOX&apos;s American Idol took this honor. The show was also the #1 new show of the season until CBS&apos; Criminal Minds surpassed it. Its major competitor in the 9:00 p.m. timeslot was FOX&apos;s House , which airs after American Idol .</text>

	<text>Commander in Chief was an American drama television series that focused on the presidential administration and family of Mackenzie Allen (portrayed by Geena Davis ), the first female President of the United States , who ascended to the role after the previous chief executive, Teddy Bridges (played by Will Lyman ), died in office from a sudden cerebral aneurysm . The series began broadcasting on ABC on Tuesday, September 27 , 2005 , at 9 p.m. Eastern Time , although most countries outside North America began screening the series in mid-2006. It garnered the highest ratings for a series debut on a Tuesday night.</text>

	<text>According to the rules of Presidential succession, if Allen began serving out Bridges&apos; term less than two full years after he was sworn in, she can only run as a candidate in one Presidential election. However, if Bridges&apos; time in office was more than two full years (even by a matter of a week or two) Allen would be allowed to run in two Presidential elections, and thus could potentially be president for almost ten years (See Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution ).</text>
