	<text>Glenn&apos;s presence was too much for Boyd and Janae and their marriage came to an end when Boyd chose Glenn over Janae. Janae moved back in with her family, and Glenn moved back to Tasmania after realising that Boyd had never gotten over Janae. After Max&apos;s departure, Steph and Toadie decided to give things another try and Toadie moved back into No.32. In summer 2007, Boyd decided he had nothing to stick around for now his family had all left and his marriage had failed, so when his ex-girlfriend Sky Mangel was heading up North he decided to join her. In late 2007, Steph&apos;s grandmother Valda Sheergold moved in to No.32. Later Toadie moved out after his and Steph&apos;s disatrous non-wedding. Valda recently decided to return to Shelley Bay not long after Steph&apos;s friend Libby Kennedy and her son Ben Kirk moved in. Steph recently let her new barman Ty Harper move in when she discovered him sleeping in the office of Charlie&apos;s. Lyn Scully will also stay as a house guest.</text>
