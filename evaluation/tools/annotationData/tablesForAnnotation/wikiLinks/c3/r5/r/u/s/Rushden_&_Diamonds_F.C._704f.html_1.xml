	<text>The Diamonds enjoyed early success in their 2007 08 FA Cup campaign. A 5-0 win over Solihull Moors was followed by a 3-1 win over Macclesfield Town . After this feat, the fans and players approached their 2nd round draw against Bristol Rovers as winnable. However, despite an early goal from Marcus Kelly , a 45-yard yard goal that was deemed &quot;goal of the day&quot; by Match of the Day , the Diamonds lost the game 5-1, in poor conditions. A disappointing result it was, however, in the two games which followed the Diamonds scored 6 goals. The Diamonds went into the Christmas break in 17th place. 12 points behind a play-off place, and 26 points behind league leaders Aldershot . After the Christmas break Rushden began to improve and had an unbeaten run from 29 January to 12 March including wins versus Ebbsfleet, Farsley, Altrincham and Woking but that run was ended with a 2-1 loss versus Histon . They recently became runners up of the Setanta Shield losing out to Aldershot after a thrilling 3-3 draw resulted in a penalty shoot-out and also got knocked out of the FA Trophy in the Quarter-Finals. Diamonds eventually finished the season in 16th place. On 15 May 2008, Garry Hill started his summer spending by signing strikers Daryl Clare on a free and Lee Phillips for an undisclosed fee.</text>

	<text>The club started 2007 08 with mixed fortunes. The Diamonds drew 1-1 away at Woking on the first day, courtesy of a goal from Curtis Woodhouse . A Wayne Hatswell header ensured victory over Farsley Celtic in the second match, however Diamonds lost 1-0 at home to Ebbsfleet United . Diamonds however then hit a poor run of form, with only 2 league wins in their next 13 games. With the team looking very disjointed, manager Garry Hill was widely expected to sign a new striker in the August Transfer Window but did not. This was eventually solved with the signing of Craig McAllister from Grays Athletic on loan who made an immediate impact as Rushden beat Oxford United 5-0. McAllister however, chose to sign for Oxford instead of making the move permanent in January 2008 .</text>

	<text>In July 2006 Helen Thompson became chairman of Rushden and Diamonds FC. In November 2006, the club was taken over by former Peterborough United vice-chairman Keith Cousins. In December 2006, former Farnborough and Stevenage manager Graham Westley was appointed as Rushden &amp; Diamonds manager, with the aim of getting the club out of the relegation battle and build towards promotion back into the football league . After a seven-game unbeaten run, which featured five wins and two draws, Graham Westley was relieved of his duties on 24 February 2007 for unknown reasons. Two days later it was announced that former Weymouth manager Garry Hill would be Westley&apos;s replacement.</text>

	<text>During their final two seasons in the Football League, Rushden &amp; Diamonds enjoyed a fierce rivalry with fellow Northamptonshire club Northampton Town .

	<text>The 2005 06 season saw the club perform towards the lower end of the table as expected by the media. Manager Hunter rebuilt the squad in the January transfer window, and at the same time sold youth team products Andy Burgess, David Bell, and John Dempster. However, the club continued to struggle and on 29 April , Rushden were relegated to the Conference after a 2-0 defeat at Boston United , which resulted in manager Barry Hunter being told his contract would not be renewed at the end of the season. Paul Hart took over as manager on 23 May and on 7 July signed former Gillingham F.C. defender Chris Hope on a 2-year deal. Other close-season signings have included Leo Fortune-West , Glenn Wilson, Paul Watson and Jon Ashton . However, following a poor run of results, Hart left by mutual consent in mid-October, with goalkeeping coach Tony Godden becoming caretaker manager.</text>

	<text>Ernie Tippett was appointed temporary manager of the team for the last three games of the 2003 04 season, and confirmed as permanent manager for the start of the 2004 05 season. Despite bringing in a large number of new players, after a dismal run of results which saw the team the media predicted as promotion contenders fall to 22nd place in League 2 , he was sacked. Barry Hunter became caretaker manager again, and although there were many applicants for the position, he was appointed full-time manager towards the end of the season. The club staved off relegation but released several players at the conclusion of the campaign.</text>

	<text>2003 04 was a difficult season for Rushden and Diamonds. The club&apos;s board and supporters were hopeful of another promotion challenge, and some promising results in the early part of the season suggested that this could be achieved. But a run of bad results during the winter saw the club slip down the table and in March 2004 Brian Talbot left the club after seven years as manager to take charge at Oldham Athletic . Barry Hunter , with no previous managerial experience, was appointed as the caretaker player-manager, but with the club needing to offload its top players to balance the books it continued to slide further down the second division table and they were relegated in 22nd place after losing their last game of the season.</text>
