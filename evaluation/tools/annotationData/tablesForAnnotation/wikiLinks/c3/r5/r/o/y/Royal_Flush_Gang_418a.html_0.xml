	<text>Two other versions of this gang were seen in the animated continuity. According to the Justice League episode, &quot;Wild Cards&quot; the original Royal Flush Gang were orphans born with superpowers. After showing signs of these superpowers, the government took them away to a secret facility to use them as human weapons. It is revealed in Justice League Unlimited that the five of them were involved in the experiments done by Project Cadmus . During their confinement, the members of the Royal Flush Gang were educated by the government, and trained to use their powers. Breaking into the facility, The Joker murdered the staff, freed the gang, and they pledged their allegiance to him. They would later participate in a reality show in Las Vegas, helping the Joker in his plans to use Ace&apos;s power to drive the world into madness. During this time, they clashed with the Justice League and were thoroughly defeated. Ace was the only one to escape harm.</text>

	<text>In a nod to the Batman Beyond series as a part of the DCAU, &quot;Melanie Walker&quot; was used as an alias by the Lost Experience &apos;s Persophone prior to an appearance by the hacker at the 2006 San Diego Comic Con on July 22. (see the entry for July 21, 2006)</text>

	<text>In the Justice League Unlimited episode &quot;Epilogue&quot;, Ace creates a new version of the gang to have friends to play with. Amanda Waller stated that this was the second or third generation of the gang.</text>

	<text>In the Batman Beyond series, the new Batman repeatedly faces a future version of the gang, who appear to be a family. They all mostly used various high-tech weapons, with the Walker parents as King and Queen, their son as Jack and daughter Melanie as Ten. It should be noted that this version of the gang resembles the group created by Hector Hammond, down to their riding hovering playing cards and Ace being an android. Its suggested that crime runs in the family: in the episode King&apos;s Ransom we learn that the former King was the father of the current Queen, with each new generation forming a new version or branch of the gang. Melanie Walker/Ten was also a romantic interest for Terry McGinnis , creating much the same conflict as existed between the original Batman and Catwoman , so much so that Bruce Wayne mentions the relationship.</text>

	<text>The version of the Royal Flush Gang seen in the episode &quot;The Wild Cards&quot;, is a quartet of thieves recruited by the mysterious Ace (here not an android). Ace is revealed to not only be in league with Darkseid , but also to be the Joker in disguise. By the end of the episode, Ten switches sides and the rest of the Gang and Joker are captured.</text>

	<text>The people Ace empowered decided to go out and commit crimes instead. As the League battled the Gang (minus Ace), Amanda Waller revealed that Ace was dying, and a possible psychic backlash caused by her death could kill millions. Batman volunteered to use a device to kill her before that could happen. Instead, he discarded the device and stayed with Ace, comforting her until she died quietly. With Ace gone, the remaining members of the gang lost their powers.</text>
