	<text>ng Nupedia when I was, as an ABD philosophy graduate student, soliciting Jimbo&apos;s (and other friends&apos;) advice on a website I was thinking of starting. It was the first I had heard of Jimbo&apos;s idea of an open content encyclopedia, and I was delighted to take the job.&quot; ^ a b &quot; Ben Kovitz &quot;, WikiWikiWeb . Retrieved on 2007 - 03-25 . -- Ben Kovitz wrote on his Wikipedia user page about his conversation in Pacific Beach, San Diego at the taco stand with Larry Sanger that led to the creation of Wikipedia, stating in part: &quot;I suggested that he run Nupedia as a wiki: completely reverse the prior policy of careful review by credentialed experts before letting an article go live. I said, instead of trying to prevent error and bias, to openly invite error and bias and make it very easy for people to correct them. It&apos;s a rare thing to tell someone to do something exactly the opposite of what he&apos;s been doing and get a fair hearing. It almost never happens that someone actually takes the suggestion. But Larry is different. Larry listened to what I had to say, let his imagination engage, and ran with it. Back then, wikis were a very hard concept to &quot;get,&quot; but Larry&apos;s mind began percolating immediately, and he got things started that very night.&quot; ^ a b c Moody, Glyn. &quot; This time, it&apos;ll be a Wikipedia written by experts &quot;, The Guardian , July 13, 2006 . Retrieved on 2007 - 03-25 . -- While casting around for a way to speed up article production, Sanger met with Ben Kovitz, an old friend, in January 2001. Kovitz introduced Sanger to the idea of the wiki, invented in 1995 by Ward Cunningham: web pages that anyone could write and edit. &quot;My first reaction was that this really could be what would solve the problem,&quot; Sanger explains, &quot;because the software was already written, and this community of people on WikiWikiWeb&quot; - the first wiki - &quot;had created something like 14,000 pages&quot;. Nupedia, by contrast, had produced barely two dozen articles. Sanger took up the idea immediately: &quot;I wrote up a proposal and sent it [to Wales] that evening, and the wiki was then set up for me to work on.&quot; But this was not Wikipedia as we know it. &quot;Originally it was the Nupedia Wiki - our idea was to use it as an article incubator for Nupedia. Articles could begin life on this wiki, be developed collaboratively and, when they got to a certain stage of development, be put it into the Nupedia system.&quot; ^ a b Sidener, Jonathan. &quot; Wikipedia co-founder looks to add accountability, end anarchy &quot;, The San Diego Union-Tribune , September 23, 2006 . Retrieved on 2007 - 03-25 . &quot;The origins of Wikipedia date to 2000, when Sanger was finishing his doctoral thesis in philosophy and had an idea for a Web site.&quot; ^ Poe, Marshall. &quot; The Hive &quot;, The Atlantic Monthly , September, 2006, p. 3 . Retrieved on 2007 - 03-25 . -- Over tacos that night, Sanger explained his concerns about Nupedia s lack of progress, the root cause of which was its serial editorial system. As Nupedia was then structured, no stage of the editorial process could proceed before the previous stage was completed. Kovitz brought up the wiki and sketched out wiki magic, the mysterious process by which communities with common interests work to improve wiki pages by incremental contributions. If it worked for the rambunctious hacker culture of programming, Kovitz said, it could work for any online collaborative project. The wiki could break the Nupedia bottleneck by permitting volunteers to work simultaneously all over the project. With Kovitz in tow, Sanger rushed back to his apartment and called Wales to share the idea. Over the next few days he wrote a formal proposal for Wales and started a page on Cunningham s wiki called WikiPedia. ^ a b Wales, Jimmy. &quot; LinkBacks? &quot; (Email), wikipedia-l archives , Bomis , October 30, 2001 .
