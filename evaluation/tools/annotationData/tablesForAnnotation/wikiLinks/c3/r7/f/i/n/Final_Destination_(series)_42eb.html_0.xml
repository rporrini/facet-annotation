	<text>Despite its total destruction within the first few minutes of the film, the plane s predestined effects allows Flight 180 to serve as a MacGuffin , and a Chekhov&apos;s Gun evidenced by the death-related imagery in the pre-flight part of the film. Later in the series, the plane&apos;s flight number appears extremely frequently, and the characters occasionally associate it with the flight and take it as a bad omen. Appearances in the second film include a car crash at mile marker 180 on a back road that leads to the death of three survivors, which happens after an electronic construction sign that reads NEXT 180 FEET. In the second film when Kim just saw the premonition she saw a sign that said &quot;Next 180&quot; the same sign is seen in the third film. As well as in the third film in which the ID on the subway is 081, becoming 180 in the reflection of the train s windows before crashing. More examples include a large neon sign that reads Le Miro 81 . When it falls apart, it swings backwards and hits Carter. From behind, the last letters read 18 o .</text>

	<text>Several minutes before takeoff, one of the passengers, Alexander Chance Browning ( Devon Sawa ), has a premonition of the plane&apos;s explosion. He causes a minor uproar, and he gets himself thrown off the plane along with his best friend, Tod Wagner ( Chad Donella ), soon to be his girlfriend, Clear Rivers ( Ali Larter ), Carter Horton ( Kerr Smith ) and his girlfriend, Terry Chaney ( Amanda Detmer ), Billy Hitchcock ( Seann William Scott ) and Mrs. Valerie Lewton ( Kristen Cloke ). Alex is soon proved to be correct when Flight 180 explodes as predicted. As seen in the first film, the survivors soon learn that Alex&apos;s vision went against the death&apos;s design, which is not just a biological event but a nearly conscious force that causes people to die at a predetermined time. The survivors begin dying in the order they would have on Flight 180 (depending on the seating arrangement and a small diagram displayed on the news which explained how the engine exploded, which brought together the death order and seating) and he sets out to save them, which becomes the plot of the first film.</text>

	<text>Vol e Air Flight 180 is the fictional flight route designator for the flight featured at the beginning of the film; most of the flight and subsequent crash was based on the real life crash of TWA Flight 800 . It is assumed that the flight routinely flies from John F. Kennedy International Airport near New York City to Charles de Gaulle International Airport in Paris , France . On the night of the crash, Flight 180 is being operated by a Boeing 747-200 aircraft when it explodes on a 9:25 PM take-off just off Queens and burns up in the Atlantic Ocean on May 13 , 2000 , with the loss of 287 lives. Among the passengers are 39 high school students from Mount Abraham High School and their four chaperons. Several days later, the National Transportation Safety Board rules that metal fatigue had deteriorated silicon insulation on an electrical connector to the plane&apos;s scavenge pump, sparking electrical wires in a fluid line . This ignited a fuel tank in the fuselage and caused the explosion.</text>

	<text>A recurring theme in each Final Destination films is the concept of truly defeating Death. Constant intervention is shown to merely keep repeating the list. Once the list of Death&apos;s Design runs through, it rewinds to the beginning. The only way to defeat Death is through &quot;new life&quot;. This is first introduced by the mortician Bludworth in the second film. So far, one way has been determined to cheat Death once and for all, while another remains a theory.</text>
