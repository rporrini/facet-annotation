	<text>The economy has been booming and according to the United States Census Bureau , residents of Nassau County have among the highest per capita wealth in the country. Nassau County has also experienced heavy urbanization in many areas, such as Hempstead , Freeport , Mineola , and Westbury , leading some to say that some parts of the county resemble the outer boroughs of New York City rather than a suburb of it, though the Five Towns region tends to be more affluent than western Queens. The northern &quot;Gold Coast&quot; region tends to more closely resemble nearby Westchester County .</text>

	<text>In the 1990s, Nassau County saw huge budget problems, forcing the county to near bankruptcy . The county government increased taxes to prevent a takeover by the state of New York. This has led to the county having notoriously high property taxes , leaving some migrants from New York City who are seeking suburban life to move to Suffolk County , the Hudson Valley , New Jersey , Connecticut or Pennsylvania .</text>

	<text>During the latter part of the 20th Century, Nassau County saw an influx of migrants from the five boroughs of New York City, especially Brooklyn and Queens, who left their urban dwellings for a more suburban setting. This led to a massive boom in population in the county, especially on the south shore. In 1947, William Levitt built his first planned community in Nassau County, in the Island Trees section (later renamed Levittown ). (This should not be confused with the county&apos;s first planned community, in general, which is Garden City ). In later decades, communities such as Wantagh , East Meadow , Massapequa , Massapequa Park , and Franklin Square began to grow.</text>

	<text>County police services are provided by the Nassau County Police Department . The cities of Glen Cove and Long Beach , as well as a number of villages, such as Freeport , Garden City , Hempstead , Lake Success , Malverne , Lynbrook , Rockville Centre , and Sands Point , are not members of the county police district and maintain their own police forces. The same goes for the villages and unincorporated areas of Port Washington , which belong to the Port Washington Police District, the only such district in New York State. These smaller forces, however, make use of such specialized county police services as the police academy and the aviation unit. Also, all homicides in the county are investigated by the county police, regardless of whether or not they occur within the police district.</text>

	<text>The United Nations Security Council was temporarily located in Nassau County from 1946 to 1951. Council meetings were held at the Sperry Gyroscope headquarters in the village of Lake Success near the border with Queens County. It was here on June 27 , 1950 that the Security Council voted to back U.S. President Harry S Truman and send a coalition of forces to the Korean Peninsula , leading to the Korean War .</text>

	<text>In 1910 (some sources state 1918), the Village of Glen Cove became a city and seceded from the Town of Oyster Bay. In 1918, the Village of Long Beach was incorporated in the Town of Hempstead. In 1922, it became a city and seceded from the Town. These are the only two cities in Nassau County.</text>

	<text>In 2006, Village leaders in the county seat of Mineola expressed dissatisfaction with the level of police coverage provided by the county force and actively explored seceding from the police district and having the village form its own police force. A referendum on December 5 , 2006 , however, decisively defeated the proposal.</text>
