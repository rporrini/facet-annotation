	<text>There is a considerable historical debate over the Sonderweg question, concerning whatever the nature of German politics and society during the German Empire made Nazi Germany inevitable. Some historians, such as Fritz Fischer , Hans-Ulrich Wehler , and Wolfgang Mommsen , have argued that during the German Empire, a &quot;pre-modern&quot; aristocratic elite became entrenched in German society and thus doomed the Weimar Republic to failure before it was even born. Other historians, such as Gerhard Ritter , have argued that it was only World War I and its aftermath that opened the doors to Nazism .</text>

	<text>The empire&apos;s support of Austria-Hungary &apos;s invasion of Serbia against Russia &apos;s opposition has been seen by a number of historians as a major influence in what caused the clash of alliances in Europe which resulted in the massive war later known as World War I. The defeat and aftermath of World War I and the territorial and economic losses imposed by the Treaty of Versailles caused enormous ramifications for the new German republic, such as defining what the German state was and how it should operate. Conservatives, liberals, socialists, nationalists, Catholics, and Protestants all had their own interpretations, which led to a fractious political and social climate in Germany in the aftermath of the empire&apos;s collapse.</text>

	<text>In the field of economics the &quot;Kaiserzeit&quot; lay the foundation of Germany being one of the world&apos;s leading economic powers. Especially the iron and coal industry of the Ruhr area , at the Saar Bassin and in Upper Silesia contibuted much to that process. The first motorcar was constructed by Karl Benz in 1886. The enormous growth of industrial production and industrial potential also led to a rapid urbanisation of Germany, which turned the Germans into a nation of city dwellers.</text>

	<text>The history of the German Empire is well remembered in Germany as a period when academic research and university life flourished as well as arts and literature. Thomas Mann published his novel Buddenbrooks in 1901. Theodor Mommsen was awarded the Nobel prize for literature a year later for his Roman history. Painters like the groups Der Blaue Reiter and Die Br cke made a significant contribution to modern art. The AEG turbine building in Berlin by Peter Behrens from 1909 can be regarded as a milestone in classic modern architecture and an outstanding example of emerging functionalism. The social, economic, and scientific successes of this Gr nderzeit , or founding epoch, have led the Wilhelmine era to sometimes be regarded as a golden age .</text>

	<text>There was a modern election system to the federal parliament, the Reichstag, which represented every adult man by one vote. This enabled the German Socialists and the Catholic Centre Party to play remarkable roles in the empire&apos;s political life, although both parties were officially regarded more or less as &quot;foes of the empire&quot;.</text>

	<text>The German Empire left a legacy of mixed fortunes for Germany and Europe. Under Bismarck, a united German state had finally been achieved, however it remained a Prussian-dominated state and it did not have German Austria within it. The influence of Prussian militarism and its colonial efforts cast a negative view of the state, especially in regards to the Herero and Namaqua Genocide and the causes of World War I. While the German Empire enacted a number of progressive social reforms such as guaranteeing freedom of press, and established a system of public welfare, at the same time it openly engaged in racist discrimination of non-Germans, leading some scholars to title it an &quot; apartheid state&quot;.</text>

	<text>In November 1918, with internal revolution , a stalemated war, Austria-Hungary falling apart from multiple ethnic tensions, and pressure from the German high command, Emperor William II, who was by this time merely a figurehead, abdicated the throne along with the German high command, leaving the disastrous scenario to be blamed on the new government led by the German Social Democrats which called for and received an armistice on November 11 , 1918 which marked the end of World War I and the end of the German Empire. It was succeeded by the democratic, yet flawed, Weimar Republic .</text>
