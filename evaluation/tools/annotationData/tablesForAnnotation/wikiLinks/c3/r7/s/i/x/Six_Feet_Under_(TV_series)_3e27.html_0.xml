	<text>Six Feet Under refers not only to being buried as a dead body is buried, but to primal emotions and feelings running under the surface. And when one is surrounded by death it seems like to counterbalance that, there needs to be a certain intensity of experience, of needing to escape. It s Nate with his sort of womanizing; it s Claire and her experimenting with dangerous boys and dangerous drugs; and it s Brenda s whole sexual compulsiveness; it s David having sex with a hooker in public; it s Ruth having affair after affair; it s the life force trying to push up through all of that suffering and grief and depression.</text>

	<text>Six Feet Under introduces the Fisher family as the basis on which to answer these questions. Throughout its five-season, 63-episode run, major characters experience crises which are in direct relation to their environment and the grief they ve experienced. Alan Ball again relates these experiences as well as the choice of the series title, to the persistent subtext of the program</text>

What does that do to their own lives - to grow up in a home where there are dead bodies in the basement, to be a child and walk in on your father with a body lying on a table opened up and him working on it? What does that do to you?</text>
