	<text>Music 4 Games&apos; reviewer, Jay Semerad, heaped Age of Mythology&apos; s soundtrack with praise. He summarized his review by declaring: &quot;In all, the Age of Mythology soundtrack is an experience that should not be missed. It&apos;s easily one of my favorite soundtracks from this past year.&quot; Semerad was also astonished, and appreciative, of the use of instruments such as the ney flute , tabla and toy piano , all of which he said produced &quot;some innovative analog and synthesized electronic effects&quot;. His only critique was that at times some of the background melodies were &quot;bound to a simple harmonization,&quot; and lacking any &quot;real bold or innovative purpose.&quot;</text>

	<text>The score was written by Music Director Stephen Rippy, and artist Kevin McMullan. Rippy cites musicians such as Peter Gabriel , Tuatara , Bill Laswell , Talvin Singh , and Tchad Blake as inspirations for the soundtrack. The musical work done on Age of Mythology was unlike anything Rippy had done before; an example of this was &quot;writing for a seventy-piece orchestra and then flying out to Washington to record it.&quot;</text>

	<text>There was much debate during Age of Mythology&apos; s construction concerning the unbalanced nature of god powers and how to make them &quot;fair&quot; while still maintaining an element of fun in them. It was concluded that the best way to make it fair for everyone was to limit the use of god powers to one a game.</text>

	<text>Age of Mythology underwent a large amount of play-testing during its developmental phase, as Ensemble Studios attempted to create a more balanced and competitive game than its predecessors. Greg T. Street commented that one of the reasons Age of Mythology became so popular was because the development team spent many hours working on the game through active testing, rather than just taking advice from a &quot;faceless drone in another building.&quot;</text>
