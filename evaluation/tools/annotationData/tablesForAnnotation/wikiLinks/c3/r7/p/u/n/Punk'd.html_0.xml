	<text>In addition to the obvious influences of past hidden camera prank shows such as Candid Camera and TV&apos;s Bloopers &amp; Practical Jokes , Scherzi a parte , Method Man , Redman and Matt Besser of the Upright Citizens Brigade had a hidden camera celebrity prank show on MTV called Stung in 2002, a full year before the introduction of Punk&apos;d . Apart from all this, MTV India has its own version of candid camera show called MTV Bakra which has been running successfully since 1999 and they haven&apos;t spared anyone - from celebs to common man. The show is hosted by MTV VJ Cyrus Broacha who himself appears in pranks. Some of the most notorious gags include a birthday girl being kidnapped, mistaken identities, Cyrus Broacha in various disguises like a barber, waiter, taxi driver etc. The show has also featured bollywood superstars like Abhishek Bachchan, Rani Mukherjee, Anil Kapoor, Raveena Tandon, Vivek Oberoi etc. MTV Bakra is the most loved and hated show in Indian television industry, media and the general public. Whether this was a direct influence on Punk&apos;d is unclear. In an issue of the hip hop magazine S.M.A.C.K. DVD Vol. 9, an interviewer asks Redman about the similarities between Stung and Punk&apos;d , and the rapper replies, &quot;Fuck you, Ashton Kutcher!&quot;, to the delight of the audience, who begin to chant the phrase.</text>

	<text>Ashton Kutcher has said that the only people he will never Punk are his wife, Demi Moore , and his stepdaughters Rumer, Scout, and Tallulah. He has stated this is because he doesn&apos;t want them to ever doubt him in an emergency situation. [ citation needed ]</text>

	<text>Talk show host Ellen DeGeneres has stated that she does not wish to be Punk&apos;d, and is so paranoid that she often assumes she is being Punk&apos;d whenever any suspicious or out of the ordinary mishap occurs, as when, for example, a valet gives her the wrong car when leaving a restaurant, which Kutcher&apos;s crew members did to Simon Cowell during the Season 5 Premiere.
