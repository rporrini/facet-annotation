	<text>In 2002 the first two books and the first interlude were adapted by Granada Television for the ITV network, although, like the 1967 production, the miniseries took many liberties with Galsworthy&apos;s original work. Additional funding for this production was provided by American PBS station WGBH , the BBC version having been a success on PBS in the early 1970s.</text>

	<text>There have been at least three BBC radio dramatisations. The first was probably a radio production entitled &apos;The Man of Property&apos; serialised and broadcast circa 1944 - 1948 on the BBC Home Service. The music used as the opening and closing theme came from Edward Elgar&apos;s Enigma Variations , specifically the Nimrod variation. Among the cast Grizelda Harvey played Irene Forsyte. Another dramatisation came soon after the 1967 TV series. The second was broadcast in 1990 and comprised a 75-minute opening episode followed by 22 hour-long episodes, entitled The Forsyte Chronicles . It was the most expensive radio drama serial ever broadcast, due to its length and its big-name cast which included Dirk Bogarde and Diana Quick . The radio series was rerun on BBC 7 radio in 2004.</text>

	<text>First Episode The Forsytes gather to celebrate Winifred Forsyte&apos;s ( Amanda Root ) engagement to Montague Dartie, a penniless but charming man. Her cousin, Young Jolyon ( Rupert Graves ), is absent from the party. We find he is at home with his daughter, June, and her governess, Helene. They are involved in a minor flirtation, but their feelings for each other are realized when his wife, Frances, falsely accuses him of an indiscretion. He cheats on her only after this accusation, and he then decides to leave Frances. Young Jolyon finds himself cut off from the Forsyte fortune and family. Nine years later, Young Jolyon has a son with Helene, and a daughter on the way. He tries to get some of the family money to afford a larger house, but his cousin, Soames Forsyte ( Damian Lewis ) refuses him. A prosperous partner in the family law firm, Soames becomes interested in the beautiful but poor Irene Heron, ( Gina McKee ). Though at first she considers him, he ultimately does not appeal to her because of his desire to own things. For example, they are at an art gallery, and she sees the beauty of a painting, while he sees it as something to be owned and mounted in his hallway. When he proposes, she refuses him. She comes to visit his family, and flouts social expectations when she dances with Winifred when she is supposed to be in mourning. Intrigued by her beauty and danger, Soames forgoes the rules and asks her to dance. Six months later, Winifred gives birth to her first child, Imogen. Montie gives her a string of pearls as a gift. She wonders how he could have afforded them seeing as how her father did not settle money or a house on Winifred when she married. At another dance, Soames attempts to show his passion for Irene, but ends up vulgarly kissing her hand in public. She is mortified, but her step-mother shuts her out of the house during a rainstorm for refusing him again. Second Episode Under pressure from her stepmother she accepts Soames&apos;s proposal under the condition that if she should not be happy, he would let her go without impediment. They share an awkward, rigid kiss in the street. Young Jolyon and Helene read in the paper that his wife, Frances has died. He proposes to Helene and she happily accepts. Contrary to what Soames has promised, two years later, we find Irene trapped in a loveless marriage. Soames is obsessed with his seemingly perfect wife, adjusting any stray strand of her hair back into place. She secretly takes steps to avoid getting pregnant as the idea of having his child repulses her. She befriends Young Jolyon&apos;s abandoned daughter, June ( Gillian Kearney ), who has been raised by her grandfather, Old Jolyon ( Corin Redgrave ). The 17-year-old June is engaged to a 26-year-old, penniless architect, Philip Bosinney ( Ioan Gruffudd ). They are not allowed to marry until Bosinney earns 400. Unbeknownst to June and Soames, Bosinney and Irene are instantly attracted to each other. Irene asks that she have her own bedroom under the guise of not being able to sleep well. Soames is not keen on the idea, but she moves out of the room anyway. Hearing of her unhappy life, Bosinney hopes to begin an affair with Irene. Simultaneously, he grows cold toward June. Soames does not like June&apos;s influence over his wife and aims to take her away from the city. He hopes that she might then concentrate on being a better wife toward him. He hires Bosinney to build a house near Richmond so he can earn the 350 to marry June. Robin Hill will serve as Irene&apos;s countryside prison. Meanwhile, Old Jolyon becomes agitated by his family, who clearly looks down on his son for marrying a governess. He pays his son a visit. Meanwhile, the Darties seem to be living a luxurious and happy life but unbeknownst to Winifred, Dartie frequently squanders her money on gambling and shaky business ventures. She catches him eyeing the pearls he once gave her. Bailiffs come to their house and start to repossess items to fulfill Dartie&apos;s debt of 300 guineas. Her father, James Forsyte, is embarrassed by the situation as how their house is in his name. Soames and Irene discuss the country house. She does not wish to live there, but he insists that she would be happy there when they have children. When she walks away, upset with the idea of children, he waits for her in her bedroom. He persuades her to come back to his bedroom, though she is still unhappy about it. Bosinney and June are still planning their wedding, although he is lackluster about it. He goes to Soames&apos;s house to discuss Robin Hill, but finds Irene there instead. They share a kiss. Bosinney and Soames discuss the plans for the house, which is thoroughly modern. When Irene shows interest in the type of house, her husband agrees to fund the project for 500 more than he first wanted to spend. Soames pats himself on the back for finding such a good architect for cheap. Old Jolyon finds his son living in bohemian poverty with his wife, and two children, Jolly (who is also named Jolyon) and Holly. Helene is offended by her father-in-law&apos;s sudden interest in their lives, and thanks God for her husband&apos;s source of income, his paintings. He tells her that his father has secretly been buying his watercolors in a way of giving him money through the years. Old Jolyon expresses his loneliness to his son. Third Episode June grows afraid that her wedding will never take place as Bosinney is always working on the house. She becomes angry at Irene&apos;s platitude that the hard times will pass, calls her old friend trite, and leaves in a huff. At Robin Hill, the building continues, but there are misunderstandings in budgeting , as he has gone over the agreed price by 700+. However, Soames relents because he wants the work done. Meanwhile, Irene and Bosinney&apos;s flirtations become more and more dangerous as they have a number of close calls. Old Jolyon asks his son to have a talk with June&apos;s fiance, to convince Bosinney to be faithful. He refuses because he did exactly what Bosinney is doing now. Meanwhile, Soames&apos;s mother has a talk with Irene. She suggests that perhaps things would be better once they have children. Irene confesses to her, &quot;I do not love him. I cannot love him. I don&apos;t want to love him.&quot; In the midst of his growing love for Irene, Bosinney snubs June in the middle of the street, driving her into a fit of depression. The entire Forsyte family knows of Irene and Bosinney&apos;s affair except for Soames and June. During a ball, they flaunt their love for each other by dancing passionately in front of the entire family. June runs off in tears, her grandfather chasing her. Irene asks Soames to let her go, but he refuses. He threatens to beat her, but then immediately apologizes. When they get home she runs into her room and locks the door to keep an enraged Soames out. Determined to ruin Bosinney for stealing his wife, he sues for breach of contract in going over the agreed price by another 400. Montague gossips and spreads the news of Irene&apos;s indiscretion. Irene and Bosinney consummate their relationship on the assumption that they can be together after the suit. However, as the court case nears, he is unable to produce future clients. Without work, he would be bankrupt at the end of the trial. She offers him her father&apos;s watch to fund his legal matters. Fourth Episode When Irene stays at Bosinney&apos;s for longer than she intended, Soames grows suspicious. June returns from a vacation in Switzerland and discovers the law suit. Despite his infidelity, she still supports him against Soames. Walking in the park, Irene and Bosinney run into Young Jolyon Forsyte painting a watercolor. She lies about why they are together, though Jolyon knows the truth. Old Jolyon goes to his brother James to withdraw his money and place it with another solicitor. He then goes to his son&apos;s house and expresses his desire to &quot;be a family again.&quot; He expects them to feel relief and gratitude at the offer, but he is told that one could be happy despite poverty. Helene and Jolyon discuss if they should take his offer. Irene asks for a divorce, but Soames refuses. She is late once again coming home from Bosinney&apos;s. In a moment of carelessness she leaves her bedroom door unlocked and Soames rapes her. The maid hears her screaming, but can do nothing. Irene meets with Bosinney the next day and he discovers the truth. In a rage, Bosinney goes to confront Soames, but as he runs through the foggy streets, he is run over by a cab and killed. She goes home and Soames attempts to reconcile, she remains fearful of him. When Bosinney does not go to his own court hearing (which he loses anyway) and he does not meet Irene at a hotel (to run away together), June and Irene go to his apartment. The two women argue; Irene compares June to Soames, and June calls Irene a leech. Finally, Irene slaps June to stop her tirade. Old Jolyon asks June what she would think of living with her father and his family. She suggests living at Robin Hill. When Soames comes home from court, the maid tells him Irene has left, taking two suitcases. Old Jolyon goes to Soames and asks to buy Robin Hill from him. However, they are interrupted when a policeman asks Soames to identify Bosinney&apos;s body. Old Jolyon has to break the terrible news to June. Last to learn is Irene, who is went to Bosinney&apos;s club in search of him. Jolyon breaks the news to her, and takes her back home. He is haunted by the expression on her face and regrets delivering her to Soames. Soames tries to convince her that Bosinney&apos;s death was a sign that they should be together. She goes up to her room in tears. Fifth Episode The next day, she leaves again, this time for good, but only with the clothes on her back. She has left her wedding ring behind. Young Jolyon meets his family again at the club, but he and his father are repulsed by Dartie&apos;s talk of Mrs. Soames. In the meantime, Soames is deluded into thinking that she will return, asking the maid to maintain the flowers in her room. June and her father reunite and embark on a newfound friendship. During the funeral, June berates Soames for his part in her fiance&apos;s death. Despite her hatred for Irene, she still defends her to him. However, she also reveals that Irene prevented the conception of any of his children. He yells back that their friendship was a sham, and she replies: &quot;Yes she stole the love of my life, my future. I should hate her, but the alternative was you. I cannot hate her. I can only wonder why she didn&apos;t do it sooner.&quot; Soames&apos;s mother comes to visit her despondent son. In the presence of his sister Winifred, he cannot speak, only cry over Irene. His mother is affectionate toward him, but she wonders if she raised a child incapable of loving another being. She mentions that when he was a boy she gave him a kitten which he smothered with his love. &quot;I should have taught you not to love like that...You feel things too much, you always have.&quot; Soames finally gets up the next morning and is fully recovered. He tells the maid not to bother with Mrs. Forsyte&apos;s room. He begins to move on with his life. Old Jolyon makes an offer on Robin Hill. He defends Irene to Soames&apos;s parents. &quot;If you talk about Irene, you do so with respect. Your son loved her once, with very good cause.&quot; The brothers settle that Jolyon will pay full price for the house. June gets along well with her father&apos;s family. She discovers a bundle of paintings she did as a child. Her father had kept them all those years passed. The family toasts to &quot;New Beginnings.&quot; Five years has passed and Helene has died. Old Jolyon is once again taking care of a granddaughter, this time a young Holly, while the rest of the family is traveling abroad. One evening, Old Jolyon notices Irene at the opera , and later again on the grounds of Robin Hill. They renew acquaintance and he invites her to give young Holly piano lessons. Since she left Soames she revealed that, she was on the verge of killing herself when a &quot;lady of the night&quot; took her in and cared for Irene. She then made a living as a piano teacher while giving what food and comfort she could to other such women. With June and Young Jolyon abroad, Irene and Old Jolyon see each other often. He and Irene grow close, and in his own way he falls in love with her. However, his health soon fails and he dies shortly after. Sixth Episode With Old Jolyon&apos;s death, Holly is devastated and has no one to look after her aside from her mam&apos;zelle. She comforts her and leaves when she has fallen asleep so she will not happen to run into June. Jolyon and June return home and discover that Irene had visited before their arrival. Young Jolyon is the executor of his father&apos;s will. To the shock of the Forsytes, Old Jolyon had made a codicil to his will that leaves Irene 15,000. Everyone comes to the funeral, but there is gossip and speculation as to why he would do that. Jolyon and June discuss what has come to pass and she states that all the people she ever loved &quot;all gravitate to her in the end.&quot; Being the executor, Jolyon visits Irene to discuss the money his father left her. She asks him to be her financial advisor, and during that time, he finds himself admiring her. She comforts him as he cries about his father&apos;s death. Twelve years pass and everyone gathers for Soames&apos;s surprise birthday party, with the exception of Jolyon&apos;s family. Though he is still married to Irene, he has met a beautiful young French woman, Annette Lamotte. She is a SoHo shopgirl, and her mother runs a restaurant in one of his properties. He invites them to visit his weekend estate, Mapledurham. He shows off his art gallery, a collection of beautiful paintings which he owns but cannot understand. In the meanwhile, Dartie and his cousin-in-law George spend their time gambling and cavorting with prostitutes. He has given Winifred&apos;s pearl necklace to one of them. He embarrasses his son, Val at the casino by stumbling about and falling down drunk. Dartie comes home after his son runs off, and his wife says that her pearls are missing. At her accusation, he reacts frantically and puts a gun to his head but when he pulls the trigger he finds that it was not loaded. He admits that he gave her necklace away. He decides to leave his family and go to Buenos Aires. Soames tries to convince Winifred to begin divorce proceedings, and he expresses his desire to &quot;start again&quot; as well. Winifred states that she would not like a divorce, which would humiliate her and her children. Soames visits his father who tells him to have a son.</text>

	<text>It was the last major British drama serial to be shot in black and white , even though the BBC was already gearing up for full time colour broadcasting. In an interview for the DVD release, Wilson admits he would have loved to have shot the programme in colour, but delaying filming would have meant re-casting and he felt he had the perfect cast for this adaptation. In 1992 it was released in the UK on an 8-volume set of videos, and on region 2 DVD in 2004. Although never credited, the music that opens and closes each episode is the first movement, &quot;Halcyon Days&quot;, from the suite The Three Elizabeths written in the early 1940s by Eric Coates , and its use very likely contributed to a resurgence in interest in the suite and its composer.</text>

	<text>The phenomenal success of the BBC&apos;s dramatisation of the novels cannot be entirely attributed to its sheer length. Both adapted for television and produced by the highly experienced Donald Wilson , it was originally shown in twenty-six episodes - thus becoming, effectively, a soap opera - on Saturday evenings between January 7 and July 1, 1967 on BBC2, but it was the repeat on Sunday evenings on BBC1 starting on September 8, 1968 that secured the programme&apos;s success with 18 million tuning in for the final episode in 1969. It was shown all over the world, and became the first British television programme to be sold to the Soviet Union. Following its transmission in 1967 by RT , the Republic of Ireland &apos;s national broadcast service, the BBC production won a Jacob&apos;s Award at the annual presentation ceremony in Dublin .</text>
