	<text>Only one week later the Cardinals were defeated by a third undefeated Big East team, the upstart and 15th-ranked Rutgers Scarlet Knights , in what was billed as the biggest college football game in the New York City Metro Area in over 60 years; with the Empire State Building even being lit with the Rutgers team colors. The games was also one the highest rated ESPN Thursday Night games ever as a record crowd in Piscataway, New Jersey stormed the field in celebration. The loss ended the Cardinals&apos; national title hopes, but the team did receive a bid to the FedEx Orange Bowl . On January 2nd the Cardinals defeated Wake Forest 24-13</text>

	<text>As recently as the 1980s, the Louisville Cardinals were considered one of the worst Division I football programs in the NCAA, and the school seriously considered disbanding the football program altogether. However, UofL hired legendary coach Howard Schnellenberger in 1984. The team has continued to rise under coaches John L. Smith and Bobby Petrino . On November 2 , 2006 , the 5th-ranked UofL football team defeated the 3rd-ranked West Virginia Mountaineers in what was dubbed &quot;The Dream Game&quot;, the second time in Big East history that two top-5 teams had ever met. The game was ranked as the most-viewed ESPN Thursday night football game ever.</text>

	<text>For all their success in basketball, the Kentucky Wildcats have been unable to remain consistently competitive in football. Playing in the brutally competitive Southeastern Conference , the Wildcats won an SEC title in 1950 under legendary coach Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant and shared SEC titles in 1976 and 1977 under Fran Curci . Bryant left the school in 1953 ; some attribute the move to a conclusion that the football program&apos;s popularity would always remain a distant second to the basketball program, at that time coached by Adolph Rupp , a legend in his own right.</text>

	<text>Professional football, baseball and basketball all at one time had teams in Kentucky. The National Football League and National League had early franchises in Louisville, and the Kentucky Colonels were a mainstay of the American Basketball Association but folded when that league merged with the National Basketball Association in 1976. The New ABA added a Louisville-based team called the Kentucky Colonels , which was active from 2004 to 2006, and announced it would locate an expansion team in Murray, Kentucky in 2007.</text>

	<text>The Kentucky Wildcats were the most dominant team of the 1990s , winning two national titles ( 1996 and 1998 ), with three straight trips to the NCAA Championship game and four total trips to the Final Four. UK&apos;s 1996 team National Championship team is considered to be the best NCAA team of all time, as evidenced by the nine players on the roster who played in the NBA .</text>
