	<text>The courthouse is packed to see the attorneys&apos; closing arguments. Jake tells the jury to close their eyes and listen to a story. He describes, in slow and painful detail, the rape of a young 10-year-old girl, mirroring the story of Tonya&apos;s rape. His final comment to the jury is to tell them to imagine the victim was white.</text>

	<text>Out of options, Jake goes to see Carl Lee in his jail cell and advises accepting a lesser guilty plea. Carl Lee refuses, telling Brigance that his views on justice and race are wrong. &quot;America is a wall,&quot; he says, &quot;and you&apos;re on the other side.&quot;</text>

	<text>Jake goes to see Roark in a hospital and feels guilty for the situation. He returns to his office and is startled by his wife, Carla ( Ashley Judd ), who has returned and tells Jake she now understands why he took on the case - because he would have done the same as Carl Lee had it been their daughter who was raped.</text>

	<text>Soon after, Freddie Lee Cobb shoots at Jake as he exits the courthouse, but misses and hits a national guardsman policing demonstrations. That evening after leaving Jake&apos;s office, Roark is abducted by Klansmen working with a racist sheriff&apos;s deputy, Willie Hastings (Mark Whitman Johnson). Roark is beaten, tied to a stake in the wilderness, and left to die.

	<text>John Grisham has worked with director Joel Schumacher before on the film adaptation of The Client with Susan Sarandon and Tommy Lee Jones . While only his book was the basis for his involvement with that film, Grisham took an active role in this film&apos;s production as a producer. The reason, as Grisham explained it, was that A Time to Kill was his first book and the favorite one out of all of his works, and he wanted to see its adaptation done to his standards.</text>

	<text>Jake&apos;s attraction to Roark grows, and nearly begin an affair before Jake gains his wits and goes home - to find that arsonists have burned down his house. The next morning, Jake sits on the still-smoking steps of his house and meets with Harry Rex, who says it is time to quit the case. Jake refuses, saying that to quit now would make his sacrifices meaningless.</text>

	<text>Before the part of Jake Brigance went to Matthew McConaughey , other actors, such as Val Kilmer , John Cusack , Robert Downey Jr. , Aidan Quinn and Brad Pitt , were considered. Woody Harrelson had lobbied for the part and Kevin Costner was close to being cast, but Grisham axed Costner because the actor wanted complete control of the project. McConaughey was originally going to play Freddie Lee Cobb, but put his hat in the ring by speaking to Joel Schumacher and convincing him to let him audition. Schumacher videotaped the audition and decided that McConaughey was right for the part. He then approached Grisham and showed him the audition, which sold Grisham on casting him.</text>

	<text>The trial begins amid much attention from the media and public. The KKK , who has a member inside the sheriff&apos;s department, burns a cross on Jake&apos;s lawn, forcing Jake to send his wife and young daughter away while the trial continues. As the trial begins, the KKK march down Canton&apos;s streets, meeting a large group of mostly black protestors at the courthouse. Chaos ensues outside the courthouse as the police lose control of the crowd. A black teenager hits the KKK Grand Dragon with a Molotov cocktail , burning him to death.</text>
