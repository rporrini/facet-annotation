	<text>From 1874 to 1974, the District was administered by a Board of Commissioners that was appointed by the President of the United States . There were three members of the Board: one Democrat , one Republican , and one civil engineer with no specified party. The three Commissioners would then elect a president from amongst themselves. This list features the Presidents of the Board of Commissioners, not quite analogous to a Mayor but the most proximal figure as the city&apos;s Chief Executive.</text>

	<text>In 1871, after major economic crises and at the behest of the its population, the District of Columbia was administered by a territorial government, which was headed by a Governor. All offices including governor were appointed by the President to a four-year term; however, owing to widespread corruption and mismanagement, the territorial government was discontinued in 1874.</text>

	<text>Georgetown was a town in Maryland until the official incorporation of the District of Columbia in 1802, when it became a municipal entry of the District (part of D.C., but separate from Washington City). From 1802 until 1871, mayors of Georgetown were elected by its citizens to one-year terms, with no term limit. Like Washington and Washington County, Georgetown&apos;s local government ceased to exist in 1871 when Congress merged the three entities into the single territorial government of the District of Columbia.</text>
