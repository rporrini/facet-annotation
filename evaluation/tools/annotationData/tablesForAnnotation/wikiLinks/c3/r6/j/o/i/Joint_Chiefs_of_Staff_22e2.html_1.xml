	<text>Today, their primary responsibility is to ensure the personnel readiness, policy, planning and training of their respective military services for the combatant commanders to utilize. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also act in an advisory military capacity for the President of the United States and the Secretary of Defense. In addition, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff acts as the chief military advisor to the President and the Secretary of Defense. In this strictly advisory role, the Joint Chiefs constitute the second-highest deliberatory body for military policy, after the National Security Council , which includes the President and other officials besides the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs.</text>

	<text>After the 1986 reorganization of the military undertaken by the Goldwater-Nichols Act , the Joint Chiefs of Staff do not have operational command of U.S. military forces. Responsibility for conducting military operations goes from the President to the Secretary of Defense directly to the commanders of the Unified Combatant Commands and thus bypasses the Joint Chiefs of Staff completely.</text>

	<text>On June 8 , 2007 , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates recommended that Admiral Mike Mullen be nominated to replace General Pace when the Congressional confirmation of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff occurs in September. Secretary Gates stated that the contentious issue of the military actions in Iraq would shift &quot; the focus of his [General Pace&apos;s] confirmation process would have been on the past rather than the future &quot; and that the &quot; divisive ordeal &quot; of the reconfirmation &quot; is not in the interest of the country. &quot; [5]</text>

	<text>To fill the need for a coordinated effort and to provide coordinated staff work, Admiral William D. Leahy proposed a concept of a &quot;unified high command&quot; in what would be called the Joint Chiefs of Staff. On July 20 , 1942 , Admiral Leahy became the Chief of Staff to the Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy and created a staff of the chiefs of staff of the services to serve under him.</text>

	<text>Though the Joint Board did exist, its authority and services were of little use to the CCS. Although its 1935 publication, Joint Action of the Army and Navy, gave some guidance for the joint operations during World War II , the Joint Board held little influence in that war. Following the end of WWII, the Joint Board was officially disbanded in 1947.</text>
