	<text>Love and Erlandson officially disbanded Hole via a message posted at the band&apos;s website in 2002. Their more than decade-long run as a band produced three studio albums that generated sales of 8 million. After the split, the four musicians each took on projects of their own. Auf der Maur joined The Smashing Pumpkins and later recorded and toured a solo album titled Auf Der Maur ; Erlandson continued to work as a producer and session musician; Maloney has worked with M tley Cr e , Scarling. , Eagles of Death Metal and Peaches ; and Love began a solo career, releasing America&apos;s Sweetheart in 2004, and is currently writing and recording her second solo album with first solo album collaborator Linda Perry . (In September 2006 a documentary of this was filmed for Bristish television station More4 . Its US debut was on VH1 in January 2007)</text>

	<text>Despite the open-handedness of the album&apos;s liner notes, some controversy still hit the press regarding the album&apos;s authorship. Reviewers of the record frequently referred explicitly to Corgan&apos;s contributions (unlike the endless records of other bands who receive outside input during songwriting). Then, some time after the album&apos;s release, Corgan appeared on Howard Stern&apos;s show, talking about how he wrote the main riff in the album&apos;s titular lead single and complaining of the poor sales for his own band&apos;s latest record. &quot;He&apos;s crazy...he thinks I stole his mojo,&quot; Love told Spin in an interview that year. Privately, their dispute was only temporary: Corgan and Love still maintain friendly and professional relations, working together on Love&apos;s forthcoming second solo album. Corgan also played bass on one track from the Celebrity Skin sessions, a song called &quot;Be A Man&quot;, which did not make the record, but ended up appearing on the Any Given Sunday soundtrack in 1999 and was Hole&apos;s last proper single/video.</text>

	<text>&quot;Doll Parts&quot; from Live Through This - This song from Hole&apos;s popular second album illustrates Hole&apos;s grunge influence as well as Courtney Love&apos;s distinctive vocals. Problems playing the files? See media help .</text>

	<text>Perhaps in reaction to public speculation that Kurt Cobain had written the band&apos;s second album, Celebrity Skin&apos;s liner notes listed explicitly every musician&apos;s contribution to the record, specifying authorship for every song. Love wrote every lyric, while Erlandson, assistant-producing alongside Michael Beinhorn, had a hand in every song. Co-songwriters on the album included bassist Melissa Auf der Maur, drummer Patty Schemel, Jordon Zadorozny of Blinker the Star , and Charlotte Caffey of The Go Go&apos;s , each contributing a bit to one or two songs, but perhaps the most notable contributor was Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins . The songwriter stopped by, according to Love, to help with phrasing, to deconstruct the songs on the piano, and in the end was given songwriting co-credit on five of the record&apos;s twelve tracks.</text>

	<text>When journalists asked the subtext to the record, Love refused to offer up explanations for the lyrics, as in her 1998 Spin magazine interview: &quot;I won&apos;t talk about it because it&apos;s none of your business...because you will never know.&quot; Years later in 2005, she spoke of Celebrity Skin to journalist Phoebe O&apos;Reilly, saying, &quot;I did not want to make the widow record. I still haven&apos;t made the widow record.&quot;</text>
