	<text>Walled City of Lahore had 13 gates which included ; Akbari Gate, Bhati Gate , Delhi Gate , Kashmiri Gate , Lohari Gate , Masti Gate , Mochi Gate , Mori Gate, Roshnai Gate , Shahalmi Gate, Shairanwala Gate , Taxali Gate , and Yakki Gate. All of these gates survived till 19th Century when the British , to defortify the city, demolished almost all of the gates except Roshnai Gate . After that some were rebuilt except for Delhi Gate and Lohari Gate in simple structures. Shahalmi Gate was burnt to ground during the riots of 1947 while Akbari Gate was also demolished for repairs but was never built again . Today out of 13 only 6 gates survives which are ; Bhati Gate , Delhi Gate , Kashmiri Gate , Lohari Gate , Roshnai Gate and Shairanwala Gate .some of these gates are in pretty poor state and need urgent attention for repairs and restoration.</text>

	<text>The Walled City of Lahore covers an area of 256 ha with a population of 200,000. The city walls were destroyed shortly after the British annexed the Punjab in 1849 and were replaced with gardens, some of which exist today. The Circular Road links the old city to the urban network. Access to the Walled City is still gained through the 13 ancient gates, or their emplacements. The convoluted and picturesque streets of the inner city remain almost intact but the rapid demolition and frequently illegal rebuilding, which is taking place throughout the city, is causing the historic fabric to be eroded and replaced by inferior constructions. Historic buildings are no exception and some have been encroached upon. The few old houses one can still see in the city are usually two or three storeys tall, with brick fa ades, flat roofs and richly carved wooden balconies and overhanging windows.</text>

	<text>It is sad that we tend to change the names of streets and areas, and even cities, at the drop of a hat as if to stamp some sort of moral authority on time. All rulers love to block out history. It would be best to let history rest and emerge as times dictate. It would not be a bad idea to declare the entire Walled City as a protected area. Let us keep for the future the little that is left of &apos;kacha kot&apos; - the mud fort that ultimately became the Walled City of Lahore.</text>

	<text>When walking through these streets, it is not hard to make out that the oldest buildings in the entire Walled City exist in this area. As one passes the old exquisite mosque known even now as Masjid Kohana Hammam Chaileywala, one is reminded that the area was named similarly once. There must have been a huge &apos;hammam&apos; here once. The tomb of Pir Bola exists after which is named the &apos;gali&apos;.</text>

	<text>But the expanding bubble definitely has its origins in three factors, they being (a) the way the Ravi has flown and how and when it has been changing its course, (b) the existence of the Lahore Fort and how power has flowed from the rulers, and (c) the manner in which the population and economy of the old original Walled City has changed over time, grown, or even shrunk, depending of invasions, droughts and famines in the countryside. The story of &apos;kacha kot&apos; has been determined by these factors.</text>

	<text>In an earlier piece we had followed a similar theory, and come up with the proposition that during the times of Mughal Emperor Akbar, the original wall of the Walled City of Lahore was, on the western side, to the right of Bazaar Hakeeman in Bhati Gate, and on the eastern side to the left of Shahalam Gate, which then curved eastwards and formed a &apos;kidney shaped&apos; city that depended on the flow of the curving River Ravi. Thus the Lahore of the &apos;kacha kot&apos; era has continued to expand in three major leaps of expansion, each with an almost 400-year gap. The eras of Raja Jaipal of Akbar and of Maharajah Ranjit Singh mark the high points of this expansion.</text>
