	<text>Of all the plans, only two were implemented: the Skylab space station (May 1973 February 1974), and the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (July 1975). Skylab &apos;s fuselage was constructed from the second stage of a Saturn IB , and the station was equipped with the Apollo Telescope Mount , itself based on a lunar module . The station&apos;s three crews were ferried into orbit atop Saturn IBs , riding in CSMs; the station itself had been launched with a modified Saturn V . Skylab&apos;s last crew departed the station on February 8 , 1974 , whilst the station itself returned prematurely to Earth in 1979, by which time it had become the oldest operational Apollo component.</text>

	<text>Following the success of the Apollo program, both NASA and its major contractors investigated several post-lunar applications for the Apollo hardware. The &quot;Apollo Extension Series&quot;, later called the &quot; Apollo Applications Program &quot;, proposed up to thirty flights to earth orbit. Many of these would use the space that the lunar module took up in the Saturn rocket to carry scientific equipment.</text>

	<text>In general the rocks collected from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They range in age from about 3.2 billion years old for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar mare , to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust.</text>

	<text>As such, they represent samples from a very early period in the development of the Solar System that is largely missing from Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program was the Genesis Rock , retrieved by astronauts James Irwin and David Scott during the Apollo 15 mission. This rock, called anorthosite , is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite , and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered that has no known terrestrial counterpart. Together, KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to infer that the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean ).</text>

	<text>The next two flights (11 and 12) included successful Moon landings. The Apollo 13 mission was aborted before the landing attempt, but the crew returned safely to Earth. The four subsequent Apollo missions (14 through 17) included successful Moon landings. The last three of these were J-class missions that included the use of Lunar Rovers. It appears that much of the original film and telemetry data for the Apollo 11 mission is missing. For more information see Apollo program missing tapes .</text>

	<text>Almost all of the rocks show evidence for having been affected by impact processes. For instance, many samples appear to be pitted with micrometeoroid impact craters, something which is never seen on earth due to its thick atmosphere. Additionally, many show signs of being subjected to high pressure shock waves that are generated during impact events. Some of the returned samples are of impact melt, referring to materials that are melted in the vicinity of an impact crater. Finally, all samples returned from the Moon are highly brecciated as a result of being subjected to multiple impact events.</text>
