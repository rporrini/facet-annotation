	<text>CMLL conducts several annual tournaments which usually signify a big push or start off storylines. Tournaments have been left out of the schedule for unexplained reasons. Tournaments are conducted as torneo cibern ticos , a large multi-man tag team elimination match or a normal single elimination tournament.</text>

	<text>CMLL&apos;s main programming, hosted by Alfonso Morales, Leobardo Magadan and Miguel Linares, is broadcast regularly on Televisa in Mexico, formerly on Galavisi n in the United States , and formerly on Telelatino in Canada and The Wrestling Channel in the United Kingdom . CMLL also had a syndicated show called &quot;Sin Limite de Tiempo&quot; (&quot;with no time limit&quot;) which shows matches from Arena Coliseo shows and matches they could not fit onto the regular broadcast. It aired in Los Angeles on KWHY . This show was followed up by &quot;Guerreros del Ring&quot; on Canal 52MX. CMLL is affiliated with New Japan Pro Wrestling as part of &quot;G-1 World.&quot; Also, Spanish-language American sports channel Fox Sports en Espa ol recently started broadcasting CMLL programming. Recently CMLL also added the mexican network cadena tres to its list of networks airing CMLL Wrestling</text>

	<text>CMLL events are held in the famous Arena Mexico in Mexico City. Of all the major promotions in the world, CMLL is one of the most conservative. Matches with blood are not broadcasted and, other than an annual cage match, gimmick matches such as ladder matches are never used. Over the past few years, many AAA wrestlers have jumped to CMLL but recently, some major wrestlers such as Vampiro and Shocker have jumped to AAA because CMLL has too many workers and does not run enough shows.</text>

	<text>Leyenda de Plata ( &quot;Silver Legend&quot; )- A tournament in honor of El Santo . This is the most prestigious of the CMLL tournaments and the tournament is usually made up of the best in-ring workers. It is done as a torneo cibern tico with the last remaining members from both teams facing each other in a normal singles match on the next show. They must also defeat the previous year&apos;s winner to win the trophy, a plaque with Santo&apos;s mask on it. Previous winners: Scorpio, Jr., El Hijo del Santo , Negro Casas , Black Warrior, Felino , Perro Aguayo, Jr. Atlantis and M stico .</text>

	<text>EMLL joined the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) as its Mexican affiliate as NWA-EMLL. in time, it pulled out in the 1980s due to promoter disunity, and the NWA&apos;s losing battle to stave off World Wrestling Entertainment &apos;s expansion and consolidation of the U.S. wrestling scene. At this time, it changed its name to Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre to make itself sound more international. At the start of the 1990s the company began appearing on Televisa . This led to a big boom in business due to national television exposure (before this, magazines were the sole medium of Lucha Libre). After the initial boom, long time booker Antonio Pe a broke off and formed his own promotion, Asistencia Asesor a y Administraci n , taking many of the young talent with him. AAA took the lead for several years but when the Mexican economy declined in the mid-1990s, AAA scaled-back and CMLL started re-building with the famous El Hijo del Santo vs. Negro Casas feud where Santo shocked the world by turning heel when he dressed up like Negro Casas&apos; brother Felino and attacked him. CMLL followed this up by pushing younger stars, leading to another boom period.</text>

	<text>Leyenda de Azul ( &quot;Blue Legend&quot; )- A tournament in honor of Blue Demon . It is secondary to the Leyenda de Plata tournament but features most of the big name wrestlers in the promotion. It has been conducted as a normal torneo cibern tico and as a one night tournament. Previous winners: Blue Panther , Tarzan Boy , Universo 2000 and Lizmark, Jr.</text>

	<text>In the 1970s, Lutteroth left the company in the hands of his son Chavo, but the company weakened with Ray Mendoza along with a few promoters breaking off and forming the Universal Wrestling Association . UWA ran in Mexico City and in nearby Naucalpan against EMLL. UWA would be a tremendous force for 15 years but due to a weakening talent pool and affiliates, it died in the 1990s.</text>

	<text>The promotion was founded by &quot;The Father of Lucha Libre&quot; Salvador Lutteroth Gonzales when he ran a card under the banner of EMLL in 1933 . The promotion flourished and quickly became the premier spot for workers. If wrestlers were big in Mexico City, they were considered stars throughout Mexico. With stars like El Santo , Bobby Bonales, Tarz n Lopez , Cavernario Galindo and Gory Guerrero (father of Eddie Guerrero ), &quot;La Empresa&quot; was at the forefront of the Lucha Libre movement and for the next 50 years, EMLL would continue its place as the leader.</text>
