	<text>Level I of the Executive Schedule is the pay grade for cabinet officials. In addition to the fifteen cabinet secretaries, six positions are listed in the Level I, of which only three (Director of the OMB, Director of the National Drug Control Policy, and the U.S. Trade Representative) have cabinet-level positions. The remaining three are as follows:</text>

	<text>The Cabinet is also important in the presidential line of succession , which determines an order in which Cabinet officers succeed to the office of the president following the death or resignation of the Vice President , Speaker of the House and the President pro tempore of the Senate . Because of this, it is common practice not to have the entire Cabinet in one location, even for ceremonial occasions like the State of the Union Address , where at least one Cabinet member does not attend. This person is the designated survivor , and they are held at a secure, undisclosed location, ready to take over if the President, Vice President, and the rest of the Cabinet are killed.</text>

	<text>During a meeting of the President&apos;s Cabinet, members are seated according to the order of precedence , with higher ranking officers sitting closer to the center of the table. Hence, the President and Vice President sit directly across from each other at the middle of the oval shaped table. Then, the Secretaries of State and Defense are seated directly to the right and left, respectively, of the President and the Secretary of Treasury and the Attorney General sit to right and left, respectively, of the Vice President. This alternation according to rank continues, with Cabinet-rank members (those not heading executive departments; the Vice President excluded) sitting at the very ends, farthest away from the president and vice president.</text>

	<text>Traditionally, the Secretary of State , the Secretary of the Treasury , the Secretary of Defense , and the Attorney General are the most important members of Cabinet, and form an inner circle. In recent years, the Secretary of Homeland Security has risen to a level of significance that is arguably closer to the &quot; big four &quot; than to the other cabinet offices.</text>

	<text>The Secretary of State was briefly known as the Secretary of Foreign Affairs (from 27 July 1789 to 15 September 1794 ), but the position was renamed Secretary of State prior to being filled for the first time in March 1790.</text>

	<text>Though the Cabinet is still an important organ of bureaucratic management, in recent years, the Cabinet has generally declined in relevance as a policy making body. Starting with President Franklin Roosevelt , the trend has been for Presidents to act through the Executive Office of the President or the National Security Council rather than through the Cabinet. This has created a situation in which non-Cabinet officials such as the White House Chief of Staff , the Director of the Office of Management and Budget , and the National Security Advisor are now as powerful as or more powerful than some Cabinet officials.</text>
