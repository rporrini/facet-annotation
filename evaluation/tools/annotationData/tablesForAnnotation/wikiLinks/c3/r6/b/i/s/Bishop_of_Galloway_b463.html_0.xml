	<text>The Bishop of Galloway , also called the Bishop of Whithorn , was the eccesiastical head of the Diocese of Galloway , said to have been founded by Saint Ninian in the mid- 5th century . The subsequent Anglo-Saxon bishopric was founded in the late 7th century or early 8th century , and the first known bishop was one Pehthelm, &quot;shield of the Picts&quot;. According to Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical tradition, the bishopric was founded by Saint Ninian , a later corruption of the British name Uinniau or Irish Finian ; although there is no contemporary evidence, it is quite likely that there had been a British or Hiberno-British bishopric before the Anglo-Saxon takeover. After Heathored (fl. 833), no bishop is known until the apparent resurrection of the diocese in the reign of King Fergus of Galloway . The bishops remained, uniquely for Scottish bishops, the suffragans of the Archbishop of York until 1492 when Galloway was placed under the new Archbishopric of Glasgow . The diocese disappeared during the Scottish Reformation , but was recreated by the Catholic Church in 1878 , although now based at Ayr .</text>

	<text>The diocese was resurrected on 4 March 1878 from the Vicariate Apostolic of the Western District. The church of Saint Andrew in Dumfries served as pro-cathedral until it was destroyed by a fire in May 1961 and the seat moved to Ayr in 1962 . The current bishop is the Right Reverend John Cunningham , the 7th Bishop of Galloway. The diocese covers an area of 9,332 km . The see is in the town of Ayr . Until 2007 the seat was located at the Cathedral Church of the Good Shepherd which was built in 1957 . In early 2007 Pope Benedict XVI accepted the petition of Right Reverend John Cunningham , the 7th Bishop of Galloway, to move the seat to St Margaret&apos;s Church, Ayr. This has now been done and the Church of the Good Shepherd has been closed.</text>
