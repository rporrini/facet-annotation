	<text>The titles of the first five episodes, &quot; Captain Cook &quot;, &quot; Corporal Punishment &quot;, &quot; Major Star &quot;, &quot; Private Plane &quot; and &quot; General Hospital &quot; are puns based on the pairing of a military rank and another word related to the episode&apos;s content. The final episode, &quot; Goodbyeee... &quot;, was the title of a period song.</text>

	<text>The final episode of this series, &quot; Goodbyeee... &quot;, is known for being extraordinarily emotive for a comedy especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally venturing forward and charging off to die in the fog and smoke of no man&apos;s land . (Melchett remains at his office but blithely orders a reluctant Darling to fight with the others.) Blackadder&apos;s final line is poignant, offered after Baldrick claims to have one last cunning plan to save them from the war:</text>

	<text>Rather than the Germans , who remain unseen (apart from one exception), Blackadder&apos;s nemeses come in the form of his superior, the eccentric General Melchett ( Stephen Fry ) who rallies his troops from a French ch teau thirty-five miles from the front, and his bureaucratic assistant, Captain Darling ( Tim McInnerny ). Darling is of equal rank to Blackadder, yet his relatively safe job &quot;folding the general&apos;s pyjamas&quot; is a cause of contempt between the two men. In particular, Blackadder is adept at using Darling&apos;s surname for maximum comedy value. Captain Darling&apos;s name was originally intended to be Captain Cartwright, until Stephen Fry remembered a boy at his school called &apos;Darling&apos;, whose name was a constant embarrassment to him.</text>

	<text>The series is set in 1917 , on the Western Front in the trenches of the First World War . Another &quot; big push &quot; is planned, and Captain Blackadder &apos;s ( Rowan Atkinson ) one goal is to avoid being killed. The series thus follows his attempts to escape the trenches through various schemes, most of which fail due to bad fortune, misunderstandings and the general incompetence of his comrades. The aforementioned comrades present themselves in the form of the idealistic Edwardian twit Lieutenant George ( Hugh Laurie ), and Private S. Baldrick ( Tony Robinson ), introduced as &quot;the world&apos;s worst cook&quot;. The first initial &quot;S&quot; is taken from the first episode of Blackadder the Third , in which Baldrick says he can&apos;t remember his first name, but assumes it must be &quot;Sodoff&quot;, as when he introduced himself to other children when he was growing up, they generally said &quot;Yes, we know, sod off Baldrick&quot;.</text>

	<text>The fourth series enlarged the cast from the third series to include Fry and McInnerny, who had appeared in guest roles in Blackadder the Third and had appeared regularly in Blackadder II . This cast appeared together in every episode of the fourth season, although the only episode to feature no guest appearances was Corporal Punishment . Miranda Richardson , who had played Elizabeth I in the second series, appeared in a guest role in one episode (as she had in the third series ). In their guest performances, actors such as Rik Mayall and Gabrielle Glaister reprised characters they had played in earlier series. Other performers, such as Bill Wallis and Lee Cornes , who had played minor roles in prior series, appeared briefly again in the fourth series as well.</text>
