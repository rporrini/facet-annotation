	<text>This is an alphabetical list of notable people who are known to have or have had the infectious disease hepatitis C . This disease, four times more infectious than HIV, has infected roughly 3% of the world&apos;s population. More than 170 million are chronic carriers (most of whom are symptomless and unaware of their infection) and are at risk of developing liver cirrhosis , liver cancer , and liver failure . It is the leading cause of liver transplant in the United States. Organizations such as the American Liver Foundation encourage celebrities to speak openly about their infection to raise awareness and encourage those at risk to get tested.</text>
