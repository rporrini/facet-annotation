	<text>Christianity is thought to have come to the area after 675 when Surrey&apos;s only known sub-king Frithuwold converted and founded Chertsey Abbey . This area was one of the last in southern England to convert formally to Christianity, however Godalming is and was a deeply pagan place. In Godalming itself there was a shrine to the war god Tiw at Tuesley (literally &quot;Tiw&apos;s Clearing&quot;) on the hill above the town (where even today gatherings there at the Winter Solstice are specifically banned) and another to Thur or Thor at Thursley a little further away. There remains much mystery surrounding a very ancient Yew at Peper Harrow or Pipers Hearg meaning, literally &quot;pagan temple&quot; and an even more ancient Druidic Grove at Newland&apos;s Corner next to Silent Pool a &quot;holy well&quot; once used for ritual offerings. Another &quot;holy well&quot; is now within the grounds of Ladywell Convent at Tuesley. After the Hundred converted to Christianity some of those shrines were sanctified as chapels and a convent still exists close to the old worship site at Tuesley. On the rough ground adjacent to the convent where the ruins of the old chapel can be found assembly is still to this day forbidden on December 21 just to make sure. In the 11th century a new parish church was built on recently drained land by the river. The oldest part of the Church of S.S. Peter &amp; Paul the Anglo-Saxon chapel still survives today and in it retains a stone decorated with pagan carvings thought to have been brought down from the original 7th Century chapel at Tuesley on the hill.</text>

	<text>There is much to remind a resident of the past in Godalming, but one of the most apparent is the Annual Town Meeting . On this day the Mayor leads the town councillors in procession down the High Street to the site of the old Hundred Court at the Pepperpot. The councillors on this one occasion wear distinctive long grey robes the origins of which certainly hark back to the witan meetings of old Saxon times. This is now the only vestige of the tribal gatherings of Godhelm&apos;s people at the very beginnings of the town&apos;s long history.</text>

	<text>In 1300 Godalming was granted the status of a town with a Town Warden and later a Mayor. When Surrey County Council was established in 1889 the old Anglo-Saxon Hundred Court system ended and the administrative centre was moved from the Pepperpot to a new site on Bridge Street in 1908. The countryside around the town which had been part of the hundred, and other parishes once part of Farnham , became Hambledon Rural District. The borough of Godalming was reduced in status back to a Town Council when Waverley borough was created in 1974.</text>
