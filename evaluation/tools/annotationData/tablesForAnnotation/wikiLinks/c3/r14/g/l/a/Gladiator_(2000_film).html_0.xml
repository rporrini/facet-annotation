	<text>Concluding that legends born in the Colosseum must die there, Commodus challenges Maximus to a duel in front of a roaring audience. Acknowledging that Maximus&apos; skill exceeds his own, Commodus deliberately stabs Maximus with a stiletto before the battle and has the wound concealed beneath his armor. In the arena, the two exchange blows before Maximus rips the sword from Commodus&apos;s hands. Commodus pulls a hidden stiletto and renews his attack, before Maximus beats him into submission and kills him. As Commodus collapses in the now-silent Colosseum, a dying Maximus begins seeing his wife and son in the afterlife. He reaches for them, but is pulled back to reality by the Praetorian prefect Quintus, who asks for instructions. Maximus orders the release of the Proximo&apos;s gladiators and Senator Gracchus, whom he reinstates and instructs to return Rome to a Senate-based government. Maximus collapses, and Lucilla rushes to his aid. After being reassured that her son is safe and Commodus is dead, Maximus dies and wanders into the afterlife to his family in the distance. Senator Gracchus and Proximo&apos;s gladiators carry his body out of the Colosseum. That night, a newly freed Juba buries Maximus&apos; two small statues of his wife and son in the Colosseum.</text>

	<text>Following the fight, Maximus meets his former servant Cicero, who reveals that Maximus&apos;s army remains loyal to him. Maximus forms a plot with Lucilla, Commodus&apos; sister, and Senator Gracchus to reunite Maximus with his army and overthrow Commodus. Commodus however, suspecting his sister&apos;s betrayal, threatens her young son and forces her to reveal the plot. Praetorian guards immediately storm Proximo&apos;s gladiator barracks, battling the gladiators while Maximus escapes. Hagen and Proximo are killed in the siege while Juba and the survivors are imprisoned. Maximus escapes to the city walls only to witness Cicero&apos;s death and be ambushed by a legion of Praetorian guards.</text>

	<text>In Rome, Commodus reopens the gladiatorial games to commemorate his father&apos;s death, and Proximo&apos;s company of gladiators are hired to participate. In a recreation of the Battle of Zama (incorrectly named the Battle of Carthage ) at the Colosseum , Maximus leads Proximo&apos;s gladiators to decisive victory against a more powerful force, much to the amazement of the crowd. Commodus descends into the arena to meet the victors and is stunned to discover Maximus as the leader of Proximo&apos;s gladiators. The Emperor, unable to kill Maximus because of the crowd&apos;s roaring approval for him, sulks out of the arena. As the games continue, Commodus pits Maximus against Tigris of Gaul, Rome&apos;s only undefeated gladiator, in an arena surrounded by chained tigers with handlers instructed to target Maximus. Following an intense battle, Maximus narrowly defeats Tigris and awaits Commodus&apos; decision to kill or spare Tigris. As Commodus votes for death, Maximus spares Tigris, deliberately insulting the Emperor and garnering the audience&apos;s approval. His bitter enemy now known as &quot;Maximus the Merciful,&quot; Commodus becomes more frustrated at his inability to kill Maximus or stop his ascending popularity while Commodus&apos; own popularity shrinks.</text>

	<text>Slave traders find Maximus and take him to Zucchabar , a rugged province in North Africa , where he is purchased by Proximo, the head of a local gladiator school. Distraught and nihilistic over the death of his family and betrayal by his empire, Maximus initially refuses to fight, but as he defends himself in the arena his formidable combat skills lead to a rise in popularity with the audience. As he trains and fights further, Maximus befriends Hagen, a Germanic barbarian, and Juba, a Numidian hunter, the latter becoming a close friend and confidant to the grieving Maximus, the two speaking frequently of the afterlife and Maximus&apos; eventual reunification with his family.</text>

	<text>General Maximus Decimus Meridius leads the Roman army to victory against Germanic barbarians in the year 180 AD , ending a prolonged war and earning the esteem of elderly Emperor Marcus Aurelius . Although the dying Aurelius possesses a son, Commodus, he decides to appoint temporary leadership to the morally-upstanding Maximus, with a desire to eventually return power to the Roman Senate . Aurelius informs Maximus and offers him time to consider before informing Commodus, who murders his father. Declaring himself the emperor, Commodus asks Maximus for his loyalty, which Maximus refuses, realizing Commodus&apos; involvement in the Emperor&apos;s death . Commodus orders Maximus&apos; execution and dispatches Praetorian Guards to murder Maximus&apos; wife and son. Maximus narrowly escapes his execution and races home only to discover his family&apos;s charred and crucified bodies in the smoldering ruins of his villa. After burying his wife and son, a grieving Maximus succumbs to exhaustion and collapses on their graves.</text>

	<text>Franzoni was given a three-picture deal with DreamWorks as writer and co-producer on the strength of his previous work, Steven Spielberg &apos;s Amistad , which helped establish the reputation of DreamWorks SKG. Franzoni was not a classical scholar but had been inspired by Daniel P. Mannix s 1958 novel Those About to Die and decided to choose Commodus as his historical focus after reading the Augustan History . In Franzoni&apos;s first draft, dated April 4 , 1998 , he named his protagonist Narcissus, after the praenomen of the wrestler who strangled Emperor Commodus to death, whose name is not contained in the biography of Commodus by Aelius Lampridius in the Augustan History . The name Narcissus is only provided by Herodian and Cassius Dio , so a variety of ancient sources were used in developing the first draft.</text>

	<text>The film won five Academy Awards in the 73rd Academy Awards ceremony, including Best Picture . The film&apos;s epic scope and intense battle scenes, as well as the emotional core of its performances, received much praise. The film&apos;s success may have helped to revive the sword and sandal subgenre of historical epics, such as the subsequent films Troy , 300 , and Scott&apos;s own Kingdom of Heaven .</text>
