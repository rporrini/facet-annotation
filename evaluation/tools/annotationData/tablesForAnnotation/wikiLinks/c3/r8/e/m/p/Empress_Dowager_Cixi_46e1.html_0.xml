	<text>In November 1861, a few days following the coup , Cixi was quick to reward Yixin, the Prince Gong, for his help. He was made head of the General Affairs Office and the Internal Affairs Office, and his daughter was made a Gurun Princess, a title usually only bestowed upon the Empress&apos; first-born daughter. Yixin&apos;s allowance also increased two-fold. However, Cixi avoided giving Yixin the absolute political power princes such as Dorgon exercised during the Shunzhi Emperor&apos;s reign. As one of the first acts from behind the curtains, Cixi (nominally along with Ci&apos;an) issued two important Imperial Edicts on behalf of the Emperor. The first stated that the two Empresses Dowager were to be the sole decision makers &quot;without interference&quot;, and the second changed the boy Emperor&apos;s era name from Qixiang ( ; &quot;Auspicious&quot;) to Tongzhi ( ; &quot;collective rule&quot;).</text>

	<text>To show the world that she had high moral standards, Empress Dowager Cixi only executed three of the eight regent ministers. Prince Gong had suggested that Sushun and others be executed by the most painful method, known as slow slicing , but Dowager Cixi declined the suggestion and decided that Sushun be beheaded, while the other two, Zaiyuan and Duanhua, marked for execution be given white silks to allow them to commit suicide. In addition, Cixi outright refused the idea of executing the family members of the ministers, as would be done in accordance with Imperial tradition of an alleged usurper. Ironically, Qing Imperial tradition also dictated that women and Princes were never to engage in politics. In breaking with tradition, Cixi became the first and only Qing Dynasty Empress to rule from &quot;behind the curtains&quot; ( ).</text>

	<text>Empress Dowager Cixi and Prince Gong produced a document called the &quot;Eight Guilts of Regent Ministers&quot;, which included allegations such as altering the late Xianfeng Emperor&apos;s wills, causing his death, and stealing power from the two Empress Dowagers.</text>

	<text>When the funeral procession started for Beijing, Cixi fully used her alliance with Prince Gong and Prince Chun . She and the boy Emperor returned to the capital before the rest of the party, along with Zaiyuan and Duanhua, two of the principle regents, while Sushun was left to accompany the deceased Emperor&apos;s procession. Cixi&apos;s early return to Beijing meant that she could plot further with Prince Gong, and ensured that the power base of the Eight Ministers were divided between Sushun and his allies, Zaiyuan and Duanhua . History was re-written and the Regents were dismissed for having carried out incompetent negotiations with the &quot;barbarians&quot; which had caused Xianfeng Emperor to flee to Rehe &quot;greatly against his will&quot;, among other charges.</text>

	<text>Cixi&apos;s entrance as the absolute power figure in China came at a time of internal chaos and foreign challenges. The effects of the Second Opium War was still hovering over the country, as the Taiping Rebellion continued their seemingly unstoppable advance through China&apos;s south, eating up the Qing Empire bit by bit. Internally, both the national bureaucracy and regional authorities were infested with rampant corruption. 1861 happened to be the year of official examinations, whereby officials of all levels presented their political reports from the previous three years. Cixi decided that the time was ripe for a bureaucratic overhaul, where she personally sought audience with all officials above the level of provincial governor, who had to report to her personally. Cixi took on part of the role usually given to the Bureacratic Affairs Department ( ). Cixi also executed two prominent officials to serve as examples as a more immediate solution. Qingying, a military shilang who had tried to bribe his way out of demotion, and He Guiqing, then Viceroy of Liangjiang , who fled Changzhou in the wake of an incoming Taiping army as opposed to trying to defend the city.</text>

	<text>Tensions grew between the Eight Regent Ministers, headed by Sushun , and the Empress Dowagers. The ministers did not enjoy Cixi&apos;s interference in political matters, and the frequent confrontations left the Empress Dowager Ci&apos;an in an angry state, to the point where she refused to come to court audiences, leaving Empress Dowager Cixi alone to deal with the ministers. Secretly, Empress Dowager Cixi began collecting the support of talented ministers, soldiers and others who were ignored or hated by the eight regent ministers. Among them was Prince Gong , who had great ambitions and was at that time excluded from the power circle, and the Prince Chun , the 6th and 7th sons of the Daoguang Emperor, respectively. While she aligned herself with the Princes, a memorial came from Shandong asking for Cixi to &quot;Listen to politics behind the Curtains&quot;, i.e., asking Cixi to become the ruler. The same memorial also asked Prince Gong to enter the political arena as a principal &quot;aide to the Emperor&quot;.</text>

	<text>By the time of Xianfeng Emperor&apos;s death, Empress Dowager Cixi had become a brilliant manipulator. In Rehe , while waiting for an astrologically favorable time to transport the coffin back to Peking, Empress Dowager Cixi plotted to grab power. Cixi&apos;s position as the lower Empress Dowager was neither convenient nor legitimate when it came to political power. In addition, the young emperor was not yet enough of a factor to be taken into political consideration. As a result, it became necessary for her to ally herself with other power figures. Taking advantage of the late emperor&apos;s principal wife, the Empress Dowager Ci&apos;an&apos;s naivete and good nature, Cixi suggested that they become co-reigning Empress Dowagers, with powers exceeding the Eight Regent Ministers.</text>

	<text>Another significant challenge Cixi faced was the increasingly decrepit state of the country&apos;s Manchu elite. Since the beginning of the dynasty most major positions at court had been held by Manchus, and Emperors had generally shown contempt for powerful Han Chinese . Cixi, again in a reversal of Imperial tradition, entrusted the country&apos;s most powerful military unit against the Taiping army into the hands of a Han Chinese, Zeng Guofan . Additionally, in the next three years, Cixi appointed Han Chinese officials to become governors of all southern Chinese provinces, raising alarm bells in an administration traditionally fond of Manchu dominance.</text>
