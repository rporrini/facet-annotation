	<text>Even though the Wizards are the only major professional sports league team within Kansas (although they were based in Missouri at the time of their founding), many Kansans also support the sports teams of Kansas City, Missouri , including the Kansas City Royals ( MLB ), the Kansas City Chiefs ( NFL ) and the Kansas City Brigade ( AFL ). All three teams except the Brigade, play at the Truman Sports Complex , located about 10 miles (16 km) from the Kansas-Missouri state line. However, the Wizards are considering relocating to a new stadium or complex in Johnson County. The Kansas City Brigade played at the Kemper Arena and will move to the new Sprint Center in 2008.</text>

	<text>Education in Kansas is governed primarily by the Kansas State Board of Education ( web ). Twice the Board has approved changes in the state science curriculum standards that encouraged the teaching of intelligent design. Both times, the standards were reversed after changes in the composition of the board in the next election.</text>

	<text>Persons in western Kansas may sometimes support the major league teams in Denver . Many people who live close to the Oklahoma state line support the Dallas Cowboys . All Chiefs games are televised throughout Kansas by television stations in Topeka and Wichita, and Broncos and Cowboys games which do not conflict with Chiefs telecasts are also broadcast across the state.</text>

	<text>Westward along the Interstate, the city of Russell , traditionally the beginning of sparsely-populated northwest Kansas, is the home of former U.S. Senator Bob Dole and the boyhood home of U.S. Senator Arlen Specter . The city of Hays is home to Fort Hays State University and the Sternberg Museum of Natural History, and is the largest city in the northwest with a population of around 20,000. Two other landmarks are located in smaller towns in Ellis County : the &quot;Cathedral of the Plains&quot; is located 10 miles (16 km) east of Hays in Victoria , and the boyhood home of Walter Chrysler is 15 miles (24 km) west of Hays in Ellis . West of Hays, population drops dramatically, even in areas along I-70, and only two towns containing populations of more than 3,000: Colby and Goodland , which are located 35 milies apart along I-70.</text>

Much of the architecture and decor of this town has a distinctly Swedish style. To the east along Interstate 70 , the historic city of Abilene was formerly a trailhead for the Chisholm Trail and was the boyhood home of President Dwight D. Eisenhower . To the west is Lucas , the Grassroots Art Capital of Kansas.</text>
