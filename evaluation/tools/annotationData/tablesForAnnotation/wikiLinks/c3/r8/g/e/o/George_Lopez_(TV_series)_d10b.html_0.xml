	<text>The show stars George Lopez , who plays a character based on his own life and named for him, a manager at a Los Angeles airplane parts manufacturing factory. George Lopez comes from a struggling childhood, where he grew up without a father and with a careless mother. As he got older he was engaged to Angela Palmero, from Cuba who he married and had two children with. The show focuses on the misadventures of George Lopez at the factory, his adventures and his relationship with his mother, wife, father in law, friends, and his children . In the show he is known for his fairly large head. He commonly uses Spanish phrases such as &quot; Qu la?&quot; (What the?) and &quot; Sabes qu ?&quot; (You know what?).</text>

	<text>In 2002 , after a couple years of performing stand-up comedy, Lopez was approached by actress Sandra Bullock to produce and star in a comedy. Bullock was concerned about the lack of Hispanic-oriented sitcoms on American television and pushed to get a sitcom on television that starred Hispanics but wasn&apos;t exclusively about the Hispanic American community. ABC , who had been criticized by Hispanic American groups for lack of Latinos on their television shows, quickly picked up the television series. For the first five seasons, the show had an all-Hispanic cast with the exception of Albanian-American actress Masiela Lusha , who played George&apos;s daughter Carmen . George Lopez said that due to creative differences between him and Lusha, Lusha&apos;s character was written out of the show after Season 5. Lusha did appear in the 2007 season premiere, when her character left to attend a college in another state, and was replaced by Aimee Garcia as George&apos;s niece, Veronica (making for an all-Hispanic cast the final season).</text>
