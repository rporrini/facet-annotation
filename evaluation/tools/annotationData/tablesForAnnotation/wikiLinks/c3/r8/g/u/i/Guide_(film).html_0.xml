	<text>A famine hits the whole region and now the villagers begin fearing for worst, they ask their spiritual guru (Raju) to fast to bring rain. At first Raju opposes the idea, going as far as telling Bhola that he is just a human like all of them and even worse a convict. But even the confession was not enough for the villagers to give up on their belief. He reluctantely goes to fast, although he does not believe that there is any relation between a man&apos;s hunger and rain. With fast Raju undergoes a spiritual transformation, and as the duration of his fast increases, his fame starts spreading and people from all corners come to see him and take his blessings. In one of the most memorable scenes an American journalist from NBC asks him whether he truly believes that his fast would bring rain, he smiles and says &quot;These people have faith in me, and I have faith in their faith&quot;. Upon hearing his fame Rosie pays him a visit, so does his mother and his friend. He now has everything he has lost a long time back, in the final scenes of movie his health is falling, and he thinks about the meaning of his life. On one hand there is Rosie, his Mother and a chance to get back to his past life, on the other hand is a cause, he eventually decides not to end his fast. In the final scene, when it starts raining and everyone rushes to outside leaving him behind, he hears the rainfall and collapses.</text>

Bhola is having a problem with his sister, Raju uses his vocal skills and knowledge to convince the girl to act according to her brother&apos;s wish. Impressed by this Bhola spreads the news through village, and he is taken as a holy man in the village. The farmers begin to bring gifts for him and start consulting him with their problems. Initially Raju enjoys this newly endowed demigod status, as this provides him with food, shelter and all the basic necessities without working too hard. He makes the village temple his abode and starts acting like a real saint, he begins growing a beard and dressing accordingly, and is called Swami Raju. Slowly he learns of the problems that plague the life of his disciples, he actually starts taking interest in their lives. He acts as a teacher to the village kids, and makes efforts to make the life a better experience for his followers.</text>
