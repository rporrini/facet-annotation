	<text>The Pacers battled through the suspensions, while the Pistons fought off an early season malaise that they attributed to their winning the NBA title the previous year. The teams split the four regular season meetings. Again, the two teams met in the playoffs, this time in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. After Detroit handily took Game One at The Palace, Indiana scored a stunning upset win in Game Two. The Pacers, although blowing an 18-point lead, won Game Three in Indianapolis . However, just as he did a year ago, Rasheed Wallace promised a Pistons win for Game Four by saying, &quot;When we return [to Detroit], we will be tied at 2-2.&quot; The Pistons rebounded with blow out wins in Games Four and Five, leading to Game Six in Indianapolis. The Pacers, knowing a loss would lead to the retirement of Miller, fought hard, but fell to the Pistons. It was the second consecutive year the Pistons won a series over Indiana in six games.</text>

	<text>The following season, on November 19 , 2004 , at the Palace of Auburn Hills , with less than a minute left in the game, Indiana led 97-82. As Pistons center Ben Wallace went up for a layup, Indiana&apos;s Ron Artest hit Wallace with a hard foul from behind. Wallace took exception and attacked Artest, shoving him in the face. Wallace than engaged in a verbal spat with Artest and a timeout was called to cool down the players. Artest tried to keep his cool so he went to the scorer&apos;s table and laid down. As he lay on the table, Artest was suddenly hit in the chest by a cup of beer thrown by a fan. Artest shockingly went into the crowd and tried to find the person who threw the beer at him. Four other Pacers, Jermaine O&apos;Neal , Stephen Jackson , David Harrison , and Anthony Johnson also fought with fans. All were suspended for varying lengths (Jackson: 30 games, O&apos;Neal: 15 games, Harrison and Johnson: six games, Reggie Miller: one game for leaving the bench to restrain Artest), with Artest carrying the longest penalty: the entire season. From the Pistons, Chauncey Billups , Derrick Coleman , Elden Campbell were suspended one game a piece, and Ben Wallace was suspended for six games.</text>

	<text>The two teams met in the 2004 Eastern Conference Finals. Indiana narrowly won Game One thanks to some late heroics from Miller. Rasheed Wallace, unimpressed by the Pacers, boldly stated &quot;They Will Not Win Game Two&quot; during an interview before the second game (locally known as the &quot;Guaran-Sheed&quot; victory). Late in Game Two, with Detroit holding a two-point lead, Billups turned over the ball, and Reggie Miller appeared to have an uncontested lay-up that would&apos;ve tied the game. However, before Miller could score, he was chased down by Detroit forward Tayshaun Prince , who leapt from behind and swatted away Miller&apos;s shot in a spectacular play. Detroit went on to win four of the next five games and took the series 4-2. The Pistons went on to win the NBA title, while the Pacers bitterly stewed. During Game Six of the Conference Finals, with Detroit clinging to a slight lead, Artest committed a flagrant foul on Hamilton, nearly causing tempers to boil over near the end of the game.</text>

	<text>This rivalry began brewing during the 2003-2004 season . The Pacers, finished with a league best 61 wins, and were not shy about reminding others, especially the Pistons, of that feat. The Pacers were led by Jermaine O&apos;Neal , Ron Artest , and Reggie Miller , and were coached by Rick Carlisle , who&apos;d been fired by Detroit at the end of the previous season. Detroit was led by Chauncey Billups , Ben Wallace , Rasheed Wallace , Tayshaun Prince , and Richard Hamilton . Their Coach at the time was Larry Brown . Indiana won the first three matchups between the two teams during the regular season, before being defeated by the Pistons in the final regular-season meeting at the Palace. That was also the first time the two teams met after Rasheed Wallace was traded to Detroit.</text>

	<text>These growing pains resulted in a stronger than ever Bulls the following season in 1990-91. With a greater concentration on teamwork, the Bulls posted the best record in the Eastern Conference with a 61-21 win-loss record and Jordan regained the MVP award after years of being accused of being a selfish player. At the same time the Piston&apos;s armor was starting to crack by old age and injury. After their upset of the Atlantic Division champ Boston Celtics 4-2 in the Conference semifinals, it was now the Pistons with something to prove as they met a title poised Chicago. Still, some doubted the Bulls and maintained that the Pistons psychological edge and bench strength would loom over the series. But three years of aches and bruises allotted the Bulls a drive that not only inspired the greatness necessary to defeat the Pistons, but the greatness necessary to conquer a decade. Proving their growth, the Bulls swept the Pistons 4-0 and ended the rivalry on a triumphant note. Isiah Thomas , Bill Laimbeer and Mark Aguirre of the Pistons, in their last show of defiance, walked off the court with :04 left on the clock so as not to congratulate the new Eastern Conference Champions. In the next round the Bulls defeated Magic Johnson and the Lakers to capture their first NBA crown. The Pistons incidentally continued to deteriorate over the years while the Bulls were just beginning their dominance of the decade.</text>

	<text>For the following 1989-90 season under new coach Phil Jackson the Bulls sought to subvert the &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; by focusing on the triangle offense or triple post offense refined by assistant coach Tex Winter . By sharing responsibility rather than shouldering it, Jordan led the Bulls to the second best record in the East at 55-27...behind the ever-tough defending champion Pistons who finished 59-23. In a pre-destined Eastern Conference Finals rematch, the Bulls pushed the Pistons like never before by forcing the series to seven games. But the Pistons showed their dominance by winning a brutal Game Seven at home by a score of 93-74. It was in this pivotal Game Seven that Scottie Pippen would suffer a migraine headache, leading many to speculate that with a healthy Pippen the Bulls may have been ready to supplant the Pistons as the best team in the East. The Pistons would go on to win their second consecutive NBA title the following round against the Portland Trail Blazers.</text>

	<text>In 1989, the Pistons were stronger than ever, posting the league&apos;s best record of 63-19. The sixth seeded Bulls (47-35) had surprising success in the playoffs by beating the superior Cleveland Cavaliers (57-25 won-loss record) 3-2 with &quot; The Shot .&quot; The Bulls upset the Atlantic Division Champs, the New York Knicks , coached by Rick Pitino , 4-2. The Bulls then squared off to meet the team that was to become their greatest rival, the Detroit Pistons , in the Eastern Conference Finals. The Bulls miraculous success seemed to continue as they took an early 2-1 lead over the Pistons. But the Pistons clamped down and employed the supposed &quot;Jordan Rules&quot; (which consisted of solely targeting Jordan) which worked so well for them the year prior. The Pistons took a stand and won three straight and would go on to win their first NBA title in the next round.</text>
