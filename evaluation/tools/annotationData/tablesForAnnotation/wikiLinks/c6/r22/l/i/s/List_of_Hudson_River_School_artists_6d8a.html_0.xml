	<text>This is an incomplete list of Hudson River School artists. The Hudson River School was a mid- 19th century American art movement by a group of landscape painters , whose aesthetic vision was influenced by romanticism . Their paintings depict the Hudson River Valley and the surrounding area, as well as the Catskill Mountains , Adirondack Mountains , and White Mountains of New Hampshire . Note that &quot;school&quot; in this sense refers to a group of people whose outlook, inspiration, output, or style demonstrates a common thread, rather than a learning institution.</text>
