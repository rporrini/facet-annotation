	<text>Ouyang Feng ( ) - Known as Xi Du ( ) or West Poison. His obsession with the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing blinded him and darkened his personality. Known for his Toad stance and serpent staff, both of which could deliver crippling or even lethal poison. His disciple and &quot;nephew&quot; Ouyang Ke was actually his illegitimate son, the result of a liaison with his sister-in-law. After seizing a slightly changed copy of the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing from Guo Jing, Ouyang Feng began his corrupted training. Despite the improper channeling of his qi , Ouyang Feng&apos;s skills were so great he was able to wrench the incomplete teachings into the power he desired; as a side effect, instead of the death any normal person would have earned, he &quot;merely&quot; goes insane. At the end of The Legend of the Condor Heroes , no one could match his martial arts, from Huang Yaoshi or Hong Qi Gong to the rising star Guo Jing. Finally, he was tricked by Huang Rong into seeking the martial artist she claimed he could never defeat. And so he ran off, never realizing that this &quot;Ouyang Feng&quot; she spoke of was himself.</text>

	<text>Hong Qigong ( ) - Known as Bei Gai ( ) or North Beggar. He was the eighteenth leader of the Beggars&apos; Sect and loved gourmet food and wine. Known for his Xiang Long Shi Ba Zhang ( The 18 Dragon Subduing Palms ), his Dog Beating Stick techniques ( ). He severed his right index finger out of guilt when his love of food caused him to fail a mission. This as well as his formidable martial arts prowess earned him the name The Nine-Fingered Beggar Master or Jiu Zhi Shen Gai ( ). Hong Qigong seemed to prefer to teach a few moves where needed (cf. Mu Nianci) as opposed to taking on disciples. Huang Rong used Hong Qigong&apos;s love of good food against him, forcing him to choose between the food and accepting herself and Guo Jing as his disciples. Naturally, he soon had two official disciples. Later, he made Huang Rong the 19th chief of the beggar sect.</text>

	<text>Duan Zhixing ( ) - Known as Nan Di ( ) or South Emperor. He was the ruler of Dali , an independent country in southern China. Famous for his Yi Yang Finger, which had both medical and combat applications. He had four disciples, all of whom were once government officials of Dali, and afterwards were known as the Fisherman, the Woodman, the Farmer, and the Scholar. Guilt over the death of Zhou Botong ( )&apos;s illegitimate child led him to renounce his throne and become a Buddhist monk, and he lived secluded in a mountain monastery with an Indian monk who was known for his ability to treat poison.</text>

	<text>Huang Yaoshi ( ) - Known as Dong Xie ( ) or East Heretic/East Evil. His name means &quot;Medicine Master Huang&quot;; nicknamed &quot;Huang Lao Xie&quot; ( &quot;Old Strange Huang&quot;). Labeled an eccentric, he did as he pleased and refused to abide by the rules and tradition that governed the world of ( Jiang Hu ) martial arts at the time. This accounted for the fact that almost his complete martial arts repertoire was created by himself, especially his renowned technique the Divine Finger Thrust. He was the master of Peach Blossom Island and at one time had seven disciples. He could usually be seen with his jade flute which, when imbued with his prodigious internal energy, could drive a person to madness. His wife tricked Zhou Botong ( ) into allowing her to read the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing, and her prodigious intellect allowed her to copy the work for her husband verbatim. Two of his disciples, Mei Chaofeng and Chen Xuanfeng secretly fell in love with each other and eloped, thinking that Huang Yao Shi would never approve of their relationship. They managed to steal the second volume of Jiu Yin Zhen Jing when they left. Huang Yaoshi&apos;s wife tried to scribe the volume out of memory again while she was pregnant. Weakened by the strain, she died during childbirth, giving birth to Huang Rong. Guilt over his wife&apos;s death prompted him to study medicine (hence the name Yaoshi) in an attempt to resurrect her, and also left Huang Yaoshi with a blind rage against those who would study the book that killed his wife. He is an honorable man and when he wants an answer he asks it directly for example when Huang Rong and Huang YaoShi met Hua Jen ( ), Guo Jing&apos;s not-yet-wedded wife, he walked up to Guo Jing looked him in the eye and said,&quot; Guo Jing, tell this Mongolian girl that you want to marry my daughter and you will never see Hua Jen again. If you say otherwise, I will kill you if you go anywhere near my daughter.&quot;</text>

	<text>Wang Chongyang ( ) - Known as Zhong Shen Tong ( ) or Central Divinity. Before he founded his Taoist school of martial arts, Quan Zhen Sect , he fought for his country against the Jurchens . He won the martial arts tournament on the mountain Hua Shan ( ) and was thus crowned the most powerful of the five. The prize was the sacred book, Scripture of Jiu Yin ( Jiu Yin Zhen Jing ). Before his death, he split the Jiu Yin Zhen Jing into two volumes: the first dealing with internal energy cultivation, the second dealing with techniques to use that internal energy. If the book were to fall in the wrong hands, it could spell disaster, and Wang Chongyang contemplated destroying the manual before he died. Instead, he decided to direct his apprentice brother, Zhou Botong ( ) to find two places to hide the volumes, preserving it for future generations. Knowing that Ouyang Feng desired the book, Wang Chongyang faked his own death and held back his last bit of life force. When Ouyang Feng attempted to steal the book, Wang Chongyang managed to strike with surprise using his last breath, severely injuring and driving Ouyang Feng away. Wang Chongyang died shortly after.</text>
