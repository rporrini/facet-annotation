	<text>Sulu and Uhura were not given first names in this series. Sulu&apos;s first name, Hikaru, was revealed non-canonically in Vonda McIntyre &apos;s Pocket Book novel &quot;The Entropy Effect&quot;. The name was &quot;officially&quot; put into the canon by George Takei in Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country . Uhura&apos;s first name was never mentioned on screen, but the name Nyota was used in fandom, and in Pocket Book novels. The Original Series holds the record for the most original novels, with over 100 published (including the James Blish and Star Trek Logs book series). Kirk&apos;s middle name was never used in the series until the episode B.E.M. in Star Trek: The Animated Series . Due to internal disagreements on the status of The Animated Series as official Star Trek canon, Kirk&apos;s middle name (&apos;Tiberius&apos;) would not become canon until the events of Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country . A tombstone in the second pilot intended for Kirk reads &quot;James R. Kirk&quot;.</text>

	<text>The series introduced television viewers to many ideas which later became common in science fiction films: warp drive, teleportation , wireless hand-held communicators and scanners, directed energy weapons , desktop computer terminals, laser surgery, starship cloaking devices , and computer speech synthesis. Although these concepts had numerous antecedents in sci-fi literature and film, they had never before been integrated in one presentation and most of them were certainly new to TV. Even the ship&apos;s automatic doors were a novel feature in 1966. In the 2002 book &apos;Star Trek: I&apos;m Working On That&apos;, William Shatner and co-author Chip Walter explore some of these technologies and how they relate to today&apos;s world.</text>

	<text>Roddenberry&apos;s production staff included art director Matt Jefferies . Jefferies designed the Enterprise ; his contribution was commemorated in the so-called Jefferies tube , which became a standard part of the (fictional) design of Federation starships. Jefferies&apos; starship concepts arrived at a final saucer-and-cylinders design that became a template for all subsequent Federation space vehicles. Jefferies also developed the main set for the Enterprise bridge (based on an original design by Pato Guzman) and used his practical experience as a WWII airman and his knowledge of aircraft design to come up with a sleek, functional, ergonomic bridge layout. Costume designer William Ware Theiss created the striking look of the Enterprise uniforms and the risqu costumes for female guest stars. Artist and sculptor Wah Chang , who had worked for Walt Disney , was hired to design and manufacture props: he created the flip-open communicator, the portable sensing-recording-computing tricorder and the phaser weapons. Later, he would create various memorable aliens, such as the Gorn .</text>

	<text>The second pilot introduced the main characters: Captain Kirk ( William Shatner ), chief engineer Lieutenant Commander Scott ( James Doohan ) and Lieutenant Sulu ( George Takei ). Sulu&apos;s title in this episode was Ship&apos;s Physicist (changed to Helmsman in subsequent episodes). Chief medical officer and the captain&apos;s confidant Dr. Leonard McCoy ( DeForest Kelley ) (a Dr. Piper was present on the pilot), Yeoman Janice Rand ( Grace Lee Whitney ) and communications officer Lieutenant Uhura ( Nichelle Nichols ) were introduced in the series&apos; third episode, &quot; The Corbomite Maneuver &quot;. Majel Barrett&apos;s role of Nurse Christine Chapel would make her debut later in the seventh episode, &quot; The Naked Time &quot;. Barrett, Roddenberry&apos;s wife, also did the voice for the ship&apos;s computer. Roddenberry&apos;s inclusion of the Asian Sulu and black Uhura, both of them intelligent, well-spoken professionals, was a bold move when most television characters of the time were white and those who weren&apos;t were often presented in a highly stereotypical manner.</text>

	<text>The Star Trek concept was first offered to the CBS network, but the channel turned it down for the more mainstream Irwin Allen production, Lost In Space . Star Trek was then offered to NBC, who commissioned and then turned down the first pilot (NBC executives would later be quoted as saying that the initial pilot episode was &apos;too cerebral&apos;). However, the NBC executives were favorably impressed with the concept and made the unusual decision to commission a second pilot: &quot; Where No Man Has Gone Before &quot;. Only the character of Spock (played by Leonard Nimoy ) remained from the original pilot, and only two cast members ( Majel Barrett and Leonard Nimoy ) carried on to the series. Much of the first pilot&apos;s footage was used in a later two-part episode, &quot; The Menagerie &quot;.</text>

	<text>The relatively young, mop-topped Russian navigator Chekov was added in the second season. There may be some truth to the unofficial story that the Soviet newspaper Pravda complained that there were no Russians among the culturally diverse characters. However, studio documentation suggests that the intention was to introduce a character with more appeal to a teenage market, especially the female sector. Water Koenig himself noted in the 40th (2006) anniversary special of Star Trek The Original series that he doubted the Pravda rumor since Star Trek was never even shown on Soviet television. It&apos;s also been claimed that former Monkees member Davy Jones may have served as a model for the character.</text>

	<text>Other innovative Star Trek features involved solutions to basic production problems. The idea of the faster-than-light warp drive was not new to science fiction, but it allowed a narrative device that permitted the Enterprise to quickly traverse space. The matter transporter, where crew members &quot;beamed&quot; from place to place, solved the problem of moving characters quickly from the ship to a planet, a spacecraft landing sequence for each episode being prohibitively expensive. The famous flip-open communicator was introduced as a plot device to strand the characters in challenging situations by malfunctioning, being lost or stolen, or out of range; absent such a device, the characters could simply beam up at the first sign of trouble.</text>

	<text>At a time when racial segregation was still firmly entrenched in many areas of the United States, Roddenberry envisaged a multi-racial and mixed-gender crew, based on his assumption that racial prejudice and sexism would not exist in the 23rd century. He also included recurring characters from alien races, including Spock , who was half human and half Vulcan , united under the banner of the United Federation of Planets .</text>

	<text>In addition, the series frequently included characters (usually security personnel wearing red uniforms) who are killed or injured soon after their introduction. So prevalent was this plot device that it inspired the term &quot; redshirt &quot; to denote a stock character whose sole purpose is to die violently in order to demonstrate the dangerous circumstances facing the main characters.</text>

	<text>In 1964, Roddenberry secured a three-year development deal with leading independent TV production company Desilu (founded by comedy stars Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz ). In Roddenberry&apos;s original concept, the protagonist was named Captain Robert April of the &quot;S.S. Yorktown &quot;. Eventually, this character became Captain Christopher Pike . The first pilot episode, &quot; The Cage &quot;, was made in 1964, with actor Jeffrey Hunter in the role of Pike after Rodenberry&apos;s first choice, Lloyd Bridges reportedly turned it down.</text>
