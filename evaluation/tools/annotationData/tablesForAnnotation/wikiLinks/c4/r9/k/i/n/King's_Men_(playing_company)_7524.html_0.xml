	<text>In the winter of 1612 13, great Court festivities celebrating the marriage of the Elector Palatine to King James&apos; daughter Princess Elizabeth were held. The King&apos;s Men gave 20 performances, including seven plays by Shakespeare ( Much Ado About Nothing twice), one by Jonson and four by Beaumont and Fletcher , reflecting their growing popularity with audiences and dominance in the King&apos;s Men&apos;s repertoire. The mysterious Cardenio , allegedly by Shakespeare and Fletcher, was also performed.</text>

	<text>On June 29 , 1613 , the Globe theatre burned down, its thatch roof set afire by squibs set off during a lavish performance of the Shakespeare/Fletcher Henry VIII . The Globe was rebuilt by the following spring, at a cost of 1400. The thatch roof was replaced with tile. During the winter of 1613 14 the company played at Court sixteen times.</text>

	<text>In 1614 Alexander Cooke and William Ostler both died; their places as sharers were taken, perhaps, by William Ecclestone and Robert Benfield . Ostler&apos;s death may have been sudden he&apos;d performed in The Duchess of Malfi not long before and was problemmatical in that he died intestate. His father-in-law, John Heminges, seized control of his theatre shares. Ostler&apos;s widow, Thomasine Heminges Ostler, sued her father in 1615 for control of the shares a suit that was apparently unsuccessful.</text>

	<text>Between October 1611 and April 1612 the King&apos;s Men performed 22 plays at Court, including The Winter&apos;s Tale and The Tempest . Their connection with The Second Maiden&apos;s Tragedy also dates from this period; the manuscript of that play reveals that Robert Gough was cast as Memphonius, while Richard Robinson was the Lady.</text>

	<text>In 1611 Jonson&apos;s Catiline was performed; apart from Richard Robinson&apos;s substitution for Armin, the cast roster was the same as for Sejanus the previous year. This may have been John Heminges&apos; last production; in 1613 he&apos;s described as &quot;stuttering.&quot; Heminges normally received the payments for the company&apos;s Court performances, as far back as 1595; he continued to be active in the company&apos;s financial affairs even after he left the stage.</text>

	<text>1609 was another plague year during which the company travelled. Nine plays were performed at Court that year. (Royal patronage was an advantage in difficult times: special payments in times of plague were made to the company in 1603, 1608, 1609, and 1610.)</text>

	<text>On April 23 , 1616 , Shakespeare died. His role as the King&apos;s Men&apos;s leading playwright would be filled by Fletcher and his various collaborators through the coming years, with Philip Massinger assuming greater prominence in the 1630s. Nathan Field joined the company in 1616; already a prominent actor, he would go on to write plays for the King&apos;s Men in his all-too-brief career with the company.</text>

	<text>Their new wealth allowed the King&apos;s Men to overcome major adversity: when the Globe Theatre burned down in 1613 (see below), the company could afford an expensive rebuild, replacing the vulnerable thatch roof with tile. The fact that the King&apos;s Men had a second theatre meant that they didn&apos;t lose all their playscripts and costumes, as the Admiral&apos;s/Palsgrave&apos;s Men would do in the Fortune Theatre fire of December 1621 (a disaster that was, for that company, the beginning of the end).</text>
