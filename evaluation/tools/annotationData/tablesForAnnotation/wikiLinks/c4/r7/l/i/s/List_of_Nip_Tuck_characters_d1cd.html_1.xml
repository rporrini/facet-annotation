His vast list of crimes include running over and disfiguring a classmate, gaybashing a transsexual, and filing false child abuse reports with child welfare against his father, Sean. Later during Season 2, Matt finds out Christian is his biological father. He was also involved with a post-op transsexual, whom he believed to be a woman, and briefly believed he was in love with. He is currently in a quasi-romantic relationship with Kimber Henry , who was romantically involved with both Sean and Christian and who has introduced him to Scientology , which he has enthusiastically embraced. Since his conversion, and possibly partially because of his involvement with Kimber, he has cut Christian out of his life for the time being, labeling him as an "SP," or suppressive personality.</td>]]></html>

A former model, pornographic actress, drug addict, and pornography producer, she is extremely self-conscious about her looks and has severe low self-esteem problems. Christian's general apathy towards Kimber's feelings - which was expressed most notably in season one, when he attempted to "trade" Kimber to a rival plastic surgeon who was in love with her in exchange for the rival's new sports car - has contributed to her poor self-image. She was a victim of the Carver, a crazed plastic surgeon, and former partner ar McNamara Troy. She also had a brief sexual relationship with Sean McNamara when he was split up with Julia. In season 4, she is an enthusiastic Scientologist who helps Matt deal with his problems through counseling. She seduced and married Matt as revenge against Christian, became pregnant with Matt's child, and eventually leaves him for Ram Peters, a former boss of hers from when she was an adult film actress.</td>]]></html>
