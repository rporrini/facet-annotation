	<text>Cousin Jeffrey , Jerry&apos;s horse-faced cousin, whom Uncle Leo always raves about. He worked for the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation . Jeffrey once got Jerry tickets to a Paul Simon concert, and a glasses-less George once claimed to see Jeffrey kissing Jerry&apos;s girlfriend in the street (it turned out to be a policewoman patting a horse). According to Uncle Leo, Jeffrey&apos;s favorite animal is the leopard because he likes the spots, and he keeps in close contact with his college botany professor , a friendship which Leo thinks is rare. Jeffrey received a citation from the city for his edible foliage tour through Central Park . Bob Sacamano , one of Kramer&apos;s best friends, who is often referred to as the source of nutty ideas or inaccurate information. Bob&apos;s father lives in Florida and is the source of faulty electric organizers, known as &quot;Willard&apos;s,&quot; that foil Kramer&apos;s run for condo board president.</text>

	<text>Lt. Bookman , played by Philip Baker Hall ( Boogie Nights ): A library cop that Jerry has eluded since his 1971 checkout of Tropic of Cancer . His dedication to his job and coincidental surname are cause for Jerry&apos;s dismissive attitude towards him. He accuses Jerry of preventing other youngsters from experiencing the books sought after adult-themed content or as Bookman refers, &quot;pee-pees and wee-wees&quot;. His character is defined by his deadpan delivery and tendency to dramatically flip his trench coat during interrogations. Appears in &quot; The Library &quot; and &quot; The Finale, Part 2 &quot; Matthew: (played by John Christian Graas): Son of the purveyor of the &quot;fat-free&quot; yogurt, Matthew is a 10-year-old boy who idolizes Jerry. He overhears Jerry swearing, and, following his idol&apos;s lead, refers to Jerry as a &quot;funny ****er&quot;. He ruins an audiocassette of Jerry&apos;s comedy, at which Jerry lets loose a torrent of obscenity. When the yogurt is revealed to have fat, Matthew cusses out Jerry again. Later Matthew puts in his two cents over whether George has a parking space. And swears. Matthew is the only recurring child character in the series, unless you count the &quot;ugly baby.&quot; Appears in &quot; The Non-Fat Yogurt &quot; and &quot; The Parking Space &quot;</text>
