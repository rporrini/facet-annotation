	<text>Media outlets such as Entertainment Weekly gave the show generally glowing reviews. Despite a cult following , FOX canceled the show in March 2002 after poor ratings . Viewership waned after a promising premiere, perhaps due to FOX airing the remaining episodes out of order and constantly moving the show across its scheduling grid. In total, 15 episodes were shown on FOX, while two unaired episodes were included in the DVD set released in the United States on August 16 , 2005 .</text>

	<text>College is &quot;the reward for surviving high school. Most people have great fun stories from college and nightmare stories from high school,&quot; Judd Apatow told the Los Angeles Times in 2006 . He also speculated on why college shows find it hard to gain a foothold on network schedules: &quot;One reason for the death of college shows is that it&apos;s difficult to be honest about campus life on network or basic cable. It&apos;s hard to portray truthfully. The truth is, kids are high, drunk and having sex. No matter what you do, you&apos;re fudging it.&quot;</text>

	<text>Undeclared is an American television series that aired on FOX during the 2001 2002 TV season. The half-hour comedy-drama / sitcom was Judd Apatow&apos;s follow-up to the TV cult classic Freaks and Geeks , which also lasted for one season. Undeclared centered on a group of college freshmen at the fictitious University of North Eastern California. Unlike Freaks , it was set in the current time of the early 2000s rather than the 1980s . It gave a humorous look at the highs and lows of college life, from young adult relationships to the dreaded freshman fifteen . It takes its name from the status of an undergraduate who has not yet decided, or &quot;declared&quot;, a specific major of study they wish to take.</text>
