	<text>Although the team does not officially retire jersey numbers, it is uncommon to find any current players wearing the number of one of the &quot;Ring of Honor&quot; inductees. The numbers of inductees Aikman (8), Staubach (12), Hayes and Smith (22), Perkins and Harris (43) and Lilly (74) were not worn during the 2006 season.</text>

	<text>As of 2007, the Cowboys&apos; flagship radio stations were KDBN-FM (93.3 The Bone) and KTCK (1310 The Ticket). Both are owned by Cumulus Media . Brad Sham returns as the team&apos;s longtime play-by-play voice. Working alongside him in 2007 is former Cowboy quarterback Babe Laufenberg , who returns after a one-year absence to replace former safety Charlie Waters. The Cowboys, who retain rights to all announcers, chose not to renew Laufenberg&apos;s contract in 2006 and brought in Waters. However, Laufenberg did work as the analyst on the &quot;Blue Star Network,&quot; which televises Cowboys preseason games not shown on national networks. The anchor station is KTVT , the CBS owned and operated station in Dallas. Previous stations which aired Cowboys games included KVIL-FM , KRLD , and KLUV-FM . Kristi Scales is the sideline reporter on the radio broadcasts.</text>

	<text>The most recent inductees were: Troy Aikman, All-Time NFL leading rusher Emmitt Smith and Michael &quot;the Playmaker&quot; Irvin, known as &quot;The Triplets&quot;. The Cowboys waited until Smith had retired as a player before inducting Aikman and Irvin, so all three could be inducted together, which occurred during half time at a Monday Night Football home game against the arch-rival Washington Redskins on September 19, 2005.</text>

	<text>However, some numbers of retired players, such as Roger Staubach #12 and Bob Lilly #74, are unofficially kept &quot;inactive&quot; to prevent them from being worn by current or future players. Troy Aikman #8, and Emmitt Smith #22, are other examples of this unofficial &quot;rule.&quot;</text>

	<text>During his tenure as Cowboys coach, Tom Landry co-hosted his own coach&apos;s show with late veteran sportscaster Frank Glieber and later with Brad Sham. Landry&apos;s show was famous for his analysis of raw game footage and for he and his co-host making their NFL &quot;predictions&quot; at the end of each show. Glieber is one of the original voices of the Cowboys Radio Network, along with Bill Mercer , famous for calling the Ice Bowl of 1967 and both Super Bowl V and VI. Mercer is perhaps best known as the ringside commentator of World Class Championship Wrestling in the 1980s. Upon Mercer&apos;s departure, Verne Lundquist joined the network, and became their play-by-play announcer by 1977, serving eight years in that capacity before handing those chores permanently over to Brad Sham, who joined the network in 1977 as the color analyst and occasional fill-in for Lundquist.</text>

	<text>Jones also had controversy. For four years he was unsuccessful in convincing Tom Landry to accept induction. Meanwhile, he refused to induct Tex Schramm (even after Schramm&apos;s induction to the Pro Football Hall of Fame). In 1993, thanks in part to the efforts of Roger Staubach as an intermediary, Landry accepted induction and had a ceremony on the day of that year&apos;s Cowboys-Giants game (Landry had played and coached for the Giants). In 2003, Jones finally chose to induct Tex Schramm. Schramm and Jones held a joint press conference at Texas Stadium announcing the induction. Unfortunately, Schramm did not live to see his ceremonial induction at the Cowboys-Eagles game that fall.</text>
