	<text>Seven men served as President of the Supreme Executive Council. (One, George Bryan, was never elected to the position, but today is considered by the Commonwealth to have been a full-fledged governor of Pennsylvania, perhaps due to the length of his term as Acting President.) Several figure prominently in the history of Pennsylvania, but none moreso than Dr. Benjamin Franklin. His presidency was one of his last acts of public service, and he died less than two years after leaving office. Franklin was also the longest serving President, having held the office for slightly over three years. There is some question about the de facto end of his term, suggesting that the aging Franklin was not actively involved in affairs of state toward the end of his presidency. (This is certainly not a consensus view, as other sources report that all actions of the Council during his term had Franklin&apos;s approval, even if that meant convening the Council at Franklin&apos;s home.) The shortest term was that of George Bryan, who served as Acting President for just over six months. Although these men may be referred to properly as Presidents of Pennsylvania their office is analogous to the modern office of Governor , and they are often included in lists of those who have held the latter title.</text>

	<text>The neighborhood of South Philadelphia contains a series of east-west streets named in honor of Pennsylvania&apos;s Presidents and early Governors. Moving south on South 25th Street are Wharton, Reed and Dickinson Streets. (Bryan, never officially elected to the office, is omitted.) Moore Street, out of sequence, follows after two intervening streets (Tasker and Morris). There is no Franklin Street in the immediate neighborhood, probably because there already was a North Franklin Street on the west side of Franklin Square , these being two of the numerous memorials to Franklin already in Philadelphia. Moore is followed by Mifflin Street, McKean Street, and Snyder Street (the latter being Pennsylvania&apos;s second and third Governors under the 1790 Constitution). Wharton Street borders Wharton Square Park , although it is not clear if the park is named after Thomas Wharton or another member of his prominent family. Dickinson College and the Dickinson School of Law , both in Carlisle, Pennsylvania , were named after John Dickinson. Dickinson was portrayed, perhaps unflatteringly, as an impediment to Independence in the musical drama 1776 , alongside a much more jovial Benjamin Franklin.</text>

	<text>The Supreme Executive Council formally convened 4 March 1777 . The first President and Vice-President were elected the following day. The Council sat in the Pennsylvania State House in Philadelphia, now known as Independence Hall . It met in what had been the Governor&apos;s Council Chamber during British rule. The Executive Council, along with the General Assembly, moved to Lancaster, Pennsylvania ahead of the British occupation of Philadelphia in the fall of 1777 the last meeting in Philadelphia took place on 23 September and the first in Lancaster on 1 October . The Council returned to Philadelphia 26 June 1778 .</text>

	<text>The 1776 Constitution stipulated that the Council meet at the same time and location as the General Assembly. In practice, the Council sat year-round: there was no formal cycle of sessions (e.g. 110th United States Congress ) and no specific date for the start of term of Counsellors or Council officers.</text>

	<text>Similarly, the office of Vice-President of Pennsylvania is analogous to the modern office of Lieutenant Governor . Of the ten men who held the office, two succeeded to the Presidency (the first Bryan de facto , the second Moore de jure ). The longest Vice-Presidential term was that of George Bryan; he served over two and a half years, although he also served as de facto Acting President for six months concurrent with his Vice-Presidential term. The shortest term was that of Matthew Smith, who served for twelve days in October 1779.</text>
