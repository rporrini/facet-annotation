	<text>As of January 9 2008, Showcase began offering the Canadian version of the Queer as Folk episodes on their website. These Canadian versions differ from the Showtime and DVD versions in that they have breaks within the episodes (where commercials would have been inserted) and make references to &quot;Showcase&quot; and &quot;Temple Street Productions presents&quot; instead of &quot;Showtime presents&quot;. Extra special is that, unlike the Season 1 DVDs, episodes 101 and 102 are presented separately and episode 102 is the rare extended version of the episode, created for broadcast during reruns of the first season and not seen since 2002. The first seven episodes were posted on January 9 and one additional episode will be posted each week until all 56 episodes from Seasons 1, 2 and 3 are online by December 15 2008.</text>

	<text>Canada&apos;s Showcase, which was making a great deal of money from the advertising demand, did briefly consider producing a sixth season, but as Showtime owned much of the rights to the series and funded much of the budget, Showcase decided against it.</text>
</context>
<context>
	<score>0.5542714</score>
	<text>However, Showtime was concerned about the rising production costs due to the strength of the Canadian Dollar. Some of the cast, however, felt that Showtime didn&apos;t want to be known as a &quot;gay only&quot; network so they cancelled the show. Publicly, at least, Ron Cowen and Daniel Lipman both stated that they didn&apos;t feel there were really any further stories that they could tell. Randy Harrison (Justin) was reported as saying that had the series gone into a sixth season, he would not have been part of it.</text>

	<score>0.5210395</score>
	<text>The series ran for five seasons (2000 to 2005 on Showtime and 2001 to 2005 on Showcase). It was believed by fans that the show could have run for another year (most of the cast originally had six year contracts but according to one rumor the contracts were renegotiated to five years after the first season).</text>

	<text>The first episode finds the four friends ending a night at Babylon, a popular gay club. Brian picks up and has sex with Justin, who falls in love with him and eventually becomes more than a one-night-stand. Brian also becomes a father that night, bearing a son with Lindsay through artificial insemination .</text>

<context>
	<score>0.4956195</score>
	<text>The show drew strong ratings for both Showtime and Canada&apos;s Showcase. In fact, in Canada, the series had such high ratings that by the end of the 5th season so many sponsors had purchased advertising time that Showcase had to air the show in an hour and ten minute time block to accommodate all the ads and not cut out any scenes. This was not a problem for Showtime, since that service is commercial free and no ads were ever broadcast during a QAF telecast.</text>

	<text>Michael&apos;s seemingly unrequited love for Brian fuels the story, which he occasionally narrates in voice-over. Justin&apos;s coming out and budding relationship with Brian has unexpected effects on Brian and Michael&apos;s lives. Justin confides in his straight high-school friend Daphne , while struggling to deal with homophobic classmates and his dismayed, divorcing parents, Craig and Jennifer. Later in the second season Justin and Michael co-create the sexually explicit underground comic &quot;Rage&quot;, featuring a &quot;Gay Crusader&quot; superhero based on Brian.</text>

	<text>The title appears to make two references. The show comes from a well-known dialect expression from some parts of Northern England, &quot;there&apos;s nought [colloquially pronounced &apos;nowt&apos;] so queer as folk&quot;, meaning &quot;there&apos;s nothing as weird as people&quot;. (The original series was set in Manchester , in North-West England.) It is also a variation on &quot;Queer as Fuck&quot;, which Channel 4 had originally called it, before changing it to its more polite form.</text>
