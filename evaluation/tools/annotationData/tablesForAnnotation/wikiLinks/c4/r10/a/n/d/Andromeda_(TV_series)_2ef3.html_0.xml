	<text>When Engels took over and the show began the more &quot;episodic&quot; format, reactions from fans were mixed. The new producers tried to lighten the &quot;doom and gloom&quot; seriousness of the original story arc, while at the same time focusing more on the Dylan Hunt character. As a result, many felt that the quality of the series had declined.</text>

	<text>In discussion on his web site&apos;s forums and various interviews over the last two years, Wolfe has elaborated that he was released from the production staff after he refused to shift the show&apos;s focus more heavily onto Kevin Sorbo &apos;s character, Dylan Hunt, by essentially making all of the show&apos;s episodes Hunt-centric.</text>

	<text>Controversy erupted during the midst of the second season when series developer and executive producer Robert Hewitt Wolfe announced he had been released from the show&apos;s production, though his influence was felt through the completion of the second season; at that point, Bob Engels was brought on to executive produce the series. The reason for the change was purportedly to make the show more episodic and open to &quot;casual viewing,&quot; as Wolfe&apos;s version although episodic had many continuing plotlines and story arcs. After the show&apos;s final episode aired, Wolfe wrote and published on his site a one-act play titled &quot;Coda&quot; that explained his intended plans for the show without contradicting the already aired episodes.</text>
