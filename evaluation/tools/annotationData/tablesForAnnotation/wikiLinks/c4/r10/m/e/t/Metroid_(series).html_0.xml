	<text>Metroid and Metroid: Zero Mission (1986/2004) Samus travels through the caverns of the planet Zebes to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting the Metroid species for galactic domination. She confronts the cybernetic lifeform Mother Brain, as well as its guardians, Kraid and Ridley. [11] In the 2004 remake Metroid: Zero Mission , it is retconned that she was ambushed by Space Pirates after defeating Mother Brain and escaped from Zebes, and her ship crash-lands back on the surface. Stripped of her Power Suit and her ship destroyed, she is forced to infiltrate the Space Pirate mothership in order to find a way off the planet with only an emergency pistol for protection. After receiving a fully powered suit from deep within the Chozo ruins, she defeats Mecha-Ridley and escapes from the mothership before it self-destructs. [5] [3] Metroid Prime (2002) Samus receives a distress signal in her new ship and travels to Tallon IV to stop the Space Pirates from exploiting a powerful radioactive substance known as Phazon. She discovers that the Chozo once settled on this planet, and their disappearance, as well as the emergence of Phazon, is due to a meteor impacting the planet decades ago. After ruining a Space Pirate mining operation and collecting the twelve Chozo Artifacts that allow access to the sealed impact crater, she confronts, and seemingly destroys, Metroid Prime, the apparent source of the planet&apos;s Phazon corruption. [3] Metroid Prime Pinball (2005) Not a separate canon game in the Metroid storyline but actually retells the story of the original Metroid Prime in pinball format. [16] Metroid Prime Hunters (2006) When the Federation receives an unusual telepathic message, Samus is sent to the remote Alimbic Cluster in the Tetra Galaxy to uncover the rumored &quot;Ultimate Power.&quot; Six rival bounty hunters that also heard the message actively attempt to secure the power before anyone else, including Samus. It transpires that the promise of ultimate power was actually a lie sent by the creature Gorea, sealed away by the Alimbics in a void between dimensions. After killing Gorea, Samus and the hunters escape the cluster, empty handed, but alive. [3] Metroid Prime 2: Echoes (2004) Samus is sent to investigate the planet Aether after a squad of GF Marines was lost there. Samus finds them all dead, killed by several creatures, mainly consisting of an evil race called the Ing. Upon meeting the only remaining member of Luminoth (the others were frozen in stasis chambers until the end of the game, where the last of the energy is replaced, and Dark Aether is destroyed), Samus learns Aether has been split into two dimensions by a meteor similar to the one that crashed on Tallon IV. Samus helps save Aether from the Ing, but encounters Metroid Prime once again, now called Dark Samus, a heavily mutated being who had copied Samus&apos; genetic code and stolen her Phazon suit at the end of her Tallon IV adventure. [3] Metroid Prime 3: Corruption (2007) Space Pirates shut down Galactic Federation computer systems and then engage in large scale combat in an attempt to further spread Phazon. Enormous Phazon-based seedships, known as Leviathans, impact planets and begin corrupting them with Phazon. Samus is charged with destroying the &apos;Phazon Seeds&apos; and restoring functionality to the Federation&apos;s computer network. After purging three planets of Phazon (including the Space Pirate homeworld), the Federation locates the source of Phazon, planet Phaaze, which is made entirely of Phazon. As the Federation engages the Space Pirates in orbit, Samus enters the depths of the planet, and succeeds at finally destroying Dark Samus and Phazon once and for all. Metroid II: Return of Samus (1991) Following the events of the previous chapters, the Galactic Federation deems the Metroid species too dangerous to exist, and, after their own failed attempts, employs Samus to travel to the Metroid homeworld, SR388, and exterminate the entire species. After killing every Metroid, Samus finds an unhatched egg behind the Queen Metroid&apos;s chamber. Before she gets the chance to destroy it, it hatches a tiny Metroid larva which imprints Samus as its mother. Helping her escape back to her ship, it is handed over by Samus to the Galactic Federation&apos;s research station for study. [11] Super Metroid (1994) Before the scientists can conduct extensive research, Samus receives a distress signal from the research lab. She returns just in time to see Ridley stealing the hatchling, having killed all of the scientists. She then follows Ridley to the rebuilt base on Zebes to stop the Space Pirates in their new plan to clone the Metroids and use them as a weapon. She kills the reborn versions of Ridley and Kraid, as well as new guardians Phantoon and Draygon, in order to confront Mother Brain once again. [3] Samus is nearly killed in the battle, but is saved, and her suit supercharged, by the Metroid hatchling, shortly before Mother Brain kills it. [11] Samus proceeds to destroy Mother Brain, and once again escapes Zebes during a countdown to an explosion. This time, the entire planet explodes, taking with it the few remaining cloned Metroids. Metroid Fusion (2002) While acting as a bodyguard for researchers on the planet SR388, Samus is infected by a native creature known as the X Parasite, originally the prey of the Metroid species. [3] Doctors surgically remove portions of her Power Suit and cured the X infection with a vaccine created from the DNA of the baby Metroid from her previous adventure. [3] The vaccine not only allowed her to survive the parasites, but to absorb them to power up her energy and weapons. She is then sent to investigate a disturbance at the space research facility, Biologic Space Labs. Here, the researchers had attempted to contain the infected Power Suit as well as a number of creature specimens taken from SR388. It is revealed that not only have the specimens been carriers of the X parasite, but an X mimicking Samus, nicknamed the SA-X, has taken control of Samus&apos;s old suit. The SA-X methodically breaks into different parts of the station to allow the X parasites to infect the entire station. [11] While trying to destroy the rapidly multiplying X as well as clones of the SA-X, Samus discovers a secret Federation Metroid breeding program. The Federation intends this for peaceful purposes and plans to capture the SA-X and conduct research on her. Realizing the threat this would pose, Samus&apos; shipboard computer, Adam, suggests that she self-destruct the station, as well as alter its propulsion to intercept with SR388 and destroy the planet as well in order to finally wipe out the X and Metroid populations. [3] Samus is confronted by one of the SA-X, which she defeats, but the parasite escapes. After changing the station&apos;s propulsion to intercept with SR388, and activating the self-destruct cycle, Samus races back to her ship. Once there, she encounters an Omega Metroid combating the weakened SA-X she had fought earlier. The SA-X is quickly destroyed by the Metroid, and Samus absorbs the SA-X parasite in order to use her regained weapons to destroy the Omega Metroid and leave the station before it explodes.

	<text>In Metroid Fusion Samus faces another opponent, the X, a parasitic life form (similar to the Ing from Prime 2: Echoes) from planet SR388. These creatures were originally the prey of the Metroids but have now multiplied out of control following the eradication of the Metroids in Metroid II . An X infects Samus but is saved by a vaccine created from the DNA of the Metroid hatchling she spared from Metroid 2 and Super Metroid. Some of the X infect her powersuit and become a clone of Samus called the SA-X, which has the same powers and capabilities as Samus and uses these to assist the other X. Samus is able to exterminate all X by destroying SR388 and the space station Fusion takes place on.</text>

	<text>Metroid Prime 2: Echoes sees Samus fighting against Dark Samus as it attempts to absorb more Phazon in order to survive on the planet Aether. She also confronts the Ing, a demon -like alien race from Dark Aether, Aether&apos;s dark twin. The Ing possess life forms, transforming them into monstrous &quot;dark&quot; versions in order to wage war with Aether&apos;s dominant race, the Luminoth, whom Samus agrees to assist by delivering Aether&apos;s planetary energy (the Light of Aether ) from Dark Aether and therefore putting an end to Dark Aether and the Ing. The introduction of the Ing was an off shoot of the Phazon based storyline and confused many long time players. Metroid Prime 3 Corruption introduced a monster called the &quot;Phaze-Ing&quot; which had similar charictaristics to the &quot;Inglet&quot;. Metroid Prime 3: Corruption is centered around Dark Samus, in conjunction with the Space Pirates, spreading Phazon across the galaxy. Samus s body begins to naturally produce Phazon, but is in danger of corruption because of overexposure. Samus eventually tracks Dark Samus to the planet the compound originated from, Phaaze, and defeats Dark Samus and destroys all Phazon as a result.</text>
