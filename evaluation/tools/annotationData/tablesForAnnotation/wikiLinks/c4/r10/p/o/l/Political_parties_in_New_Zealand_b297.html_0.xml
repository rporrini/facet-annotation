	<text>With the introduction of the Mixed Member Proportional (MMP) electoral system for the 1996 elections, however, it became much easier for smaller parties to enter parliament; but more difficult to gain election as a non-party independent. Since the change to MMP, about one third of the seats in Parliament have been held by MPs representing parties other than Labour and National. In the years before MMP, by contrast, there were sometimes no such MPs at all.</text>

	<text>Over the years, a number of &quot; third parties &quot; or so-called &quot;minor parties&quot; developed, notably the Social Credit Party , the New Zealand Party , the Values Party , and the Alliance . However, the &quot;first past the post&quot; electoral system meant that no matter how many votes a party gained nation-wide, it could not win a seat without a plurality in a particular electorate (voting district). Under such conditions, these parties mostly performed poorly in terms of making an impact in Parliament.</text>

	<text>Political parties in New Zealand evolved towards the end of the nineteenth century out of interest groups and personal cliques. Most historians regard the Liberal Party , which began its rule in 1891 , as the first real party in New Zealand politics. During the long period of Liberal Party control the party&apos;s more conservative opponents founded the Reform Party , forming the original duopoly in the New Zealand parliament.</text>
