	<text>In 2006 , Dennis Spellmann died after a long battle with cancer. At the time of his death, the school had more than $50 million in endowments. Dr. James Evans, who had been serving as the university&apos;s acting president since Spellmann&apos;s death, was chosen as Lindenwood&apos;s twenty-first president on February 9, 2007.</text>

	<text>Lindenwood was also in the news briefly in February 2005 when Spellmann refused a National Park Service grant that would have provided $200,000 for the repair of a historic building (the Daniel Boone Home) owned by the university. Spellmann reportedly said that the bureaucracy involved in a federal grant was too great to be worthwhile, and requested that the government instead apply the money to paying down the federal budget deficit.</text>

	<text>By 1989, though, Lindenwood was in trouble. Enrollment was around 800 students and the school was nearly broke. Dennis Spellmann took over and immediately began to implement changes. He eliminated co-ed dorms and put an emphasis on a &quot;values centered&quot; approach in the classroom. Some of his changes did cause controversy for the school, though. One such incident was the &quot;Pork for Tuition&quot; program that was started in 2002 . The program was designed to help rural families pay for their tuition by accepting their livestock in return for discounts. The animals were then processed and used as pork sausage, sausage, and hamburger in the school cafeteria. The program became a topic on NBC &apos;s Today Show where host Matt Lauer called the school &quot;Pork Chop U&quot;.</text>

	<text>Lindenwood University was founded in 1827 by George and Mary Easton Sibley. It is the second-oldest higher-education institution west of the Mississippi River . The story actually begins in 1812 at Fort Sibley, now known as the town of Arrow Rock, Missouri . The fort was established to help with the situation regarding the Native Americans . In 1826 , Major George Sibley co-signed a $20,000 note, but his partner bailed out of the deal and left. Sibley, now left with next to nothing, took possession of everything his former partner owned--which happened to be little more than 0.5 km (120 acres) of land in St. Charles, Missouri known as the &quot;Linden Wood&quot; because of the large amount of linden trees that grew there. In 1827 , the Sibleys started the Linden Wood School for Girls, as Mary Sibley already had been running a school in St. Charles.</text>
