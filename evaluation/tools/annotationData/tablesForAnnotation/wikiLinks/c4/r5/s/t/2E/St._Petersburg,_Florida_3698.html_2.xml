	<text>St. Petersburg is represented by teams in four major professional sports. One, the Tampa Bay Rays of Major League Baseball , plays in St. Petersburg proper, while the other three play across the bay in Tampa . All of the teams are considered to represent the entire Tampa Bay metropolitan area . The Rays began play in 1998, but have yet to be a major contender - finishing last in the American League&apos;s East Division in eight of the nine seasons they have played. The Tampa Bay Rays play their regular season games at Tropicana Field and their Spring Training Games at Progress Energy Park , giving them the unique distinction of being the only team in Major League Baseball that plays its Spring Training games in their home city.</text>

	<text>Tropicana Field , home of MLB &apos;s Tampa Bay Rays is located in the western part of downtown. The team plays its spring training games at Progress Energy Park , right down the road. This setup is unique, making St. Petersburg the only city that plays host to its baseball team during spring training as well as the regular season. Starting at the end of 2007, there is a debate over a new stadium to be built on the downtown waterfront at the current Progress Energy Park site. This new ballpark will have an overhead sail to cool gametime tempeatures and catch rain. Tropicana Field would be demolished and replaced with prime residential and retail space. If approved, completion of the stadium is planned for 2012.</text>
