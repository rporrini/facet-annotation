	<text>Since the international terminal&apos;s original completion, it has undergone two large expansions, and the entire airport is currently undergoing a large expansion stretching over twenty years (2005 - 2025). This expansion will include the addition of a high-rise office block, the construction of a multi-level car park , the expansion of both the international and domestic terminal. This latest expansion - and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations - are seen as controversial, due to the fact that the local councils , which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments, have no jurisdiction over the airport. As of April 2006, some of the proposed development has been scaled back.</text>

	<text>In 2002 , the Australian Government sold Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (later renamed to Sydney Airport Corporation Limited ), the management authority for the airport, to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings Ltd. This is majority owned by a number of Macquarie Bank infrastructure investment funds. It holds a 99 year lease on the airport which remains Crown land .</text>

	<text>Sydney Airport has three main terminals, referred to as T1 (or, to most locals, the &quot;International Terminal&quot;), T2 (the former &quot;Ansett Domestic Terminal&quot;), and T3 (the &quot;Qantas Domestic Terminal&quot;). The international terminal is separated from the other terminals by a runway which results in the need to allow for more time for passenger connections.</text>

	<text>Even once the &quot;third runway&quot; (as it is universally known to Sydneysiders), had been built, it remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over many of Sydney&apos;s inner suburbs. The 1990s saw the formation of the No Aircraft Noise Party, which gained support in areas of Sydney affected by aircraft noise.</text>

	<text>In the 1960s, the limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent. Various governments grappled (or failed to grapple) with the issue of Sydney&apos;s airport capacity for decades. Eventually the highly controversial decision to build a third runway (parallel to the existing main &quot;North-South&quot; runway, but entirely on land reclaimed from Botany Bay ) was taken, and the much-anticipated proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved indefinitely.</text>

	<text>The airport&apos;s first runways were built in 1933 , all in gravel. Some small streams where some of the present runways are located were also filled. By the 1960s the need for a new international terminal had become apparent, and work commenced in late 1966. The new terminal was officially opened on May 3, 1970, by Queen Elizabeth II . The first Boeing 747 &apos;Jumbo Jet&apos; to serve the airport, Pan American&apos;s &apos;Clipper Flying Cloud&apos; (N734PA), arrived on October 4, 1970. In the 1970s the north-south runway was expanded to become one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere. The international terminal was expanded in 1992 and has undergone several refurbishments since then.</text>
