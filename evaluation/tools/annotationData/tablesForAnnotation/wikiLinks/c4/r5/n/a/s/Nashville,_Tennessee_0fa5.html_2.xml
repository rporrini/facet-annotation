	<text>The primary daily newspaper in Nashville is The Tennessean , which, until 1998 , competed fiercely with another daily, the Nashville Banner (although the two were housed in the same building under a joint-operating agreement). Although The Tennessean now enjoys a relative monopoly on the local newspaper market, a smaller free daily called The City Paper has cut into The Tennessean&apos;s market share somewhat. Online news service NashvillePost.com competes with the printed dailies to break news of business and local/state politics. Several weekly papers are also published in Nashville, including the Nashville Scene , Nashville Business Journal , and The Tennessee Tribune . Historically, The Tennessean was associated with a broadly liberal editorial policy, while The Banner carried staunchly conservative views in its editorial pages; The Banner&apos;s heritage is carried on these days by The City Paper. The Scene is the area&apos;s alternative weekly broadsheet, while The Tribune serves Nashville&apos;s African-American population.</text>
