	<text>The previous season&apos;s tradition of using classic monsters continues into the fifth season, with the Grel (previously heard in Oh No It Isn&apos;t! ) returning in The Grel Escape , a knowing pastiche of The Chase . The Bone of Contention features the Galyari, who appeared in the Doctor Who audio play The Sandman , while the title and plot of The Relics of Jegg-Sau was inspired by a 1970s Doctor Who licensed jigsaw puzzle that depicted a scene with giant robots identical to the one that appeared in Robot .</text>

	<text>Big Finish also published an anthology of short stories, entitled Life During Wartime , that was specially written as a prelude to the Death and the Daleks audio play. Paul Cornell , the anthology&apos;s editor, described Life During Wartime as &quot;a novel written by multiple authors&quot;. Each of the collection&apos;s stories are told in chronological order, detailing events that occur when the Collection is occupied by a powerful alien force. The anthology ends on a cliff-hanger that is resolved in Death and the Daleks .</text>

	<text>The fourth season was unofficially dubbed the &quot;classic Who monsters&quot; season, with each play featuring an alien adversary that previously appeared in the Doctor Who television series. The Bellotron Incident predominantly features the Rutan Host (their major enemies, the Sontarans , are also referred to but don&apos;t actually appear), The Draconian Rage features the Draconians , The Poison Seas casts a more sympathetic light on the Sea Devils , while Death and the Daleks (the first double CD release in the series since Just War ) sees the first appearance of the Daleks within the Bernice Summerfield series. Prior to its release, Death and the Daleks was entitled The Axis of Evil to keep the appearance of the Daleks a secret.</text>

	<text>The seventh season follows the staff of the Collection as they attempt to keep things running smoothly in Braxiatel&apos;s absence. Collected Works and Old Friends , two books published during this season&apos;s run, also develop the running plots that planetoid KS-159 is under threat from the Draconians and Mim, and that the Collection itself is falling apart literally as well as figuratively without Braxiatel at its helm.</text>

	<text>While not officially part of the third season (at least as far as the numbering is concerned), the Bernice Summerfield audio play The Plague Herds of Excelis (the fourth play in Big Finish&apos;s Excelis series; the first three plays fall under the Doctor Who umbrella) takes place between The Green-Eyed Monsters and The Dance of the Dead . Chronologically, the short story anthology A Life of Surprises also falls within this gap.</text>

	<score>0.47755438</score>
	<text>The other two plays that comprise the third season focus more specifically on Bernice. The Greatest Shop in the Galaxy remains the most light-hearted play of the season, while The Dance of the Dead reintroduces the Ice Warriors from Doctor Who .</text>

	<text>Whereas the previous seasons had focused primarily on the character of Bernice Summerfield, Big Finish used the third season as an opportunity to introduce an ensemble feel to the productions. This is most evident in The Green-Eyed Monsters and The Mirror Effect where the characters Jason Kane, Adrian Wall and Irving Braxiatel are significantly developed. The latter, in particular, suggests that Braxiatel has a darker, more mysterious past than the audience has previously been led to believe.</text>
