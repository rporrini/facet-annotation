	<text>CineReel Film Society is dedicated to artistic, American-independent and foreign language cinema since its inception, presenting first-run screenings of the newest documentary and narrative films, from local to global. Many of these films (including much small, lesser-known cinema) would be unavailable to the communities in which they serve if not presented by CFS. CFS selects films that are meaningful, artistic, creative, thought-provoking and fun. They screen films with established directors and promises talents alike, and showcased cinematic movements. In addition to providing independent/foreign cinema, they also show first run mainstream blockbuster cinema in order to attract the movie-goer to their cinemas. CineReel Film Society also organizes and promotes local independent music band performances and often uses their theatres for that purpose.</text>

	<text>CineReel Film Society is a member of International Federation of Film Societies and was organized as the Etiwanda Film Society in 2002 in the Etiwanda District of a Southern California city known as Rancho Cucamonga . Etiwanda Film Society never had a permanent venue but instead just leased or used other venues such as renting a theatre from a local megaplex mainstream cinema. In mid 2007, Fontana Renaissance donated the historical Pix Theatre located in Fontana, California to the Etiwanda Film Society after it had difficulty financially and was unable to restore and preserve the theatre. Because of this donation, the Etiwanda Film Society now had a permanent venue. By late 2007, Regal Entertainment Group had closed a United Artists six screen multiplex mainstream cinema in Clovis, California that it had operated since 2002 after their buyout of United Artists Theatre Circuit. After difficulty finding a buyer, Regal signed the lease over to Etiwanda Film Society, which changed its name to CineReel Film Society after the name no longer fit the group, since they had now expanded into other areas. Meanwhile, the society also took possession of another theater in Bogalusa, Louisiana known as Trackside Cinema 5 after the cinema&apos;s parent company Silver Cinemas filed bankruptcy, closed the cinema and signed the lease over to a realtor who then signed the lease over the CineReel Film Society. CFS is expected to reopen the Trackside Cinema 5 for first run blockbuster movies only since the market demographics does not allow for independent/diverse films.</text>
