	<text>In the early 20th century, Birkenhead Docks became an important flour milling centre, with numerous companies, including Joseph Rank Ltd and Spillers, located on the Great Float&apos;s quaysides. In the 1990s, long after the industry had gone into decline, most of these buildings were demolished. Two large warehouses remain, which are being converted into residential apartments .</text>

	<text>Unlike in Liverpool , where the docks were built along the coastline of the River Mersey , Birkenhead Docks were designed as an inland system by enclosing the tidal inlet of Wallasey Pool . This was done by the construction of a coffer dam to enable land reclamation and excavations to take place. After the establishment of the Great Low Water Basin, Morpeth Dock and Egerton Dock , the Great Float was formed between 1851 and 1860 from most of what remained of Wallasey Pool. The plans for its construction were originally shown in 1844 in the Liverpool Standard newspaper.</text>

	<text>A red girdered bascule bridge at Tower Road connects the Seacombe district of Wallasey with Birkenhead. Known as the Four Bridges, as originally four movable bridges existed along Tower Road: two between the Great Float and Alfred Dock, one between the Great Float and Wallasey Dock and one between the Great Float and Egerton Dock.
