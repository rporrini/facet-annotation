	<text>The seventh season follows the staff of the Collection as they attempt to keep things running smoothly in Braxiatel&apos;s absence. Collected Works and Old Friends , two books published during this season&apos;s run, also develop the running plots that planetoid KS-159 is under threat from the Draconians and Mim, and that the Collection itself is falling apart literally as well as figuratively without Braxiatel at its helm.</text>

	<text>In the eighth season, Braxiatel returns to the Collection, which is threatened by crossfire and politics in the war between the Draconians and Mim. The war comes to an unexpected conclusion shortly after his return, and several regular characters pay a heavy price for realising too late that Braxiatel himself is the real threat. The season ends with Benny cutting her ties to the Collection and Braxiatel, and going on the run with her son Peter. The books The Two Jasons and Nobody&apos;s Children also fit into this season&apos;s arc.</text>

	<text>The previous season&apos;s tradition of using classic monsters continues into the fifth season, with the Grel (previously heard in Oh No It Isn&apos;t! ) returning in The Grel Escape , a knowing pastiche of The Chase . The Bone of Contention features the Galyari, who appeared in the Doctor Who audio play The Sandman , while the title and plot of The Relics of Jegg-Sau was inspired by a 1970s Doctor Who licensed jigsaw puzzle that depicted a scene with giant robots identical to the one that appeared in Robot .</text>

	<text>Big Finish also published an anthology of short stories, entitled Life During Wartime , that was specially written as a prelude to the Death and the Daleks audio play. Paul Cornell , the anthology&apos;s editor, described Life During Wartime as &quot;a novel written by multiple authors&quot;. Each of the collection&apos;s stories are told in chronological order, detailing events that occur when the Collection is occupied by a powerful alien force. The anthology ends on a cliff-hanger that is resolved in Death and the Daleks .</text>

	<text>Both The Shadow of the Scourge and The Dark Flame were part of Big Finish&apos;s ongoing Doctor Who line. Based in the continuity of the Virgin New Adventures, both feature Lisa Bowerman as Bernice alongside Sylvester McCoy as the Doctor and Sophie Aldred as Ace. The Plague Herds of Excelis was the epilogue to the three part Excelis cycle of Doctor Who audios, and features Iris Wildthyme , a recurring character in the Doctor Who BBC novels and Big Finish audio plays. Silver Lining was an exclusive audio drama featuring the Cybermen that came free with Doctor Who Magazine issue 351.</text>

	<text>The fourth season was unofficially dubbed the &quot;classic Who monsters&quot; season, with each play featuring an alien adversary that previously appeared in the Doctor Who television series. The Bellotron Incident predominantly features the Rutan Host (their major enemies, the Sontarans , are also referred to but don&apos;t actually appear), The Draconian Rage features the Draconians , The Poison Seas casts a more sympathetic light on the Sea Devils , while Death and the Daleks (the first double CD release in the series since Just War ) sees the first appearance of the Daleks within the Bernice Summerfield series. Prior to its release, Death and the Daleks was entitled The Axis of Evil to keep the appearance of the Daleks a secret.</text>
