	<text>Bubka officially retired from his pole vault career in 2001. His son Sergei Bubka Jr. is a tennis player and is currently a regular in ATP &apos;s second string circuits.</text>

	<text>He was the first and only (as of March 2008) athlete ever to jump over 6.10 metres in San Sebasti n , Spain in 1991. He set the current world record of 6.14 metres in 1994 after some commentators had already predicted the decline of the great sportsman. Bubka increased the world record by 21 centimetres (8 inches) in the 4 years between 1984 and 1988, more than other pole vaulters had achieved in the previous 12 years. He cleared the once considered unattainable height 6.00 meters (or better) on more than 44 occasions.</text>

	<text>Though he had complete dominance on pole vaulting at his time, he was highly unlucky in the Olympic Games. The first Olympics after his introduction into international athletics was in 1984, which was boycotted by the USSR along with the other Eastern Bloc countries. Two months before the games he vaulted 12 cm higher than the eventual Olympic gold medal winner Pierre Quinon . In 1988 Bubka entered the Seoul Olympics and won his only Olympic gold medal. In 1992 he failed to clear in his first 3 attempts and was out of the Barcelona Olympics . In Atlanta, 1996, a heel injury caused him to withdraw from the competition without making even one jump. In Sydney, 2000, he was eliminated from the final after three attempts at 5.70 m.</text>

	<text>This height had long been considered unattainable. With virtually no opponents, Bubka improved his own record over the next 10 years until he reached his career best and the current world record of 6.14 m in 1994.</text>

	<text>He set his first world record of 5.85m in 26 May 1984 which he improved to 5.88m a week after and then to 5.90 m a month after. He cleared 6.00 metres (19 feet 8 inches) on 13 July 1985 in Paris .</text>

	<text>Sergei Bubka entered international athletics in 1981 participating in the European Junior Championships where he fetched a 7th place. But the 1983 World Championships held in Helsinki proved to be his actual entry point to the mainstream world athletics, where a relatively unknown Bubka snatched the gold clearing 5.70 metres (18 feet 8 inches). The years that followed witnessed the unparalleled dominance of Bubka on pole vaulting with him setting new records and standards in pole vaulting.</text>

	<text>Sergei had a ferocious competitive spirit which was channeled into multiple sports until he met the pole vault coach Vitaly Petrov. Bubka started pole vaulting at the age of 11, when he entered Dynamo Children and Youth Sports School in Voroshilovgrad , he was trained by Vitaly Petrov there.</text>
