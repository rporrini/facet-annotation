Has a thing for 1980s music and ultimately blackmailed Sean and Christian into giving him a new face so he could leave the drug business behind and start again. Instead, Sean and Christian gave him the face of another wanted criminal and he was arrested at the airport while attempting to flee the country. Appeared briefly in a dream in the season 2 finale, encouraging Sean to kill the Carver. He also appeared in season 4 as a hallucination of Sean's, encouraging him to repeat his sexual exploits with a young babysitter. Apparently has taken on the symbolic role of Sean's inner voice for aggressive behavior. Later, Escobar convinces Christian and Sean to restore his original face. He then breaks out of security while in the clinic, and kills his accomplice to remove a threat to Sean and Christian. It is revealed later in the season that James has been working for him. In the fourth season finale, he is killed by his wife, Gala Gallardo. (deceased)</td>]]></html>
