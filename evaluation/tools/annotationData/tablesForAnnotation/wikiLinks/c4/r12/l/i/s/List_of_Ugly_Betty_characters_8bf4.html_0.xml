When it was revealed that she was the true owner of MODE , Wilhelmina plotted to gain control by starting an affair with Bradford which led to his divorcing Claire in order to marry Wilhelmina; this action prompted Claire to escape from prison to stop Wilhelmina. After Bradford's death, Claire was sent back to prison to await her murder trial; she cleared of the crime when it was revealed Claire had unknowingly been under the influence of a poisonous perfume concocted by Fey that was meant to kill Claire, but instead the perfume had caused Claire to go insane and cause the events that led to Fey's demise. Now free, she soon found herself bored and neglected by her children; after meeting with other women with similar feelings of restlessness, she was inspired to start up her own magazine, entitled Hot Flash .</td>]]></html>

A respected figure in the fashion industry, she was passed over in favor of Daniel Meade for the Editor-in-Chief job at Mode after the death of Fey Sommers; she initially plotted to gain control on Mode by undermining Daniel's authority, often taking advantage of his inexperience. Wilhelmina was also in league with Alexis Meade, passing along information about the Meades while Alexis recovered from gender reassignment surgery and plotted to frame Bradford Meade for the murder of Fey Sommers. In exchange for Wilhelmina's loyalty, Alexis immediately appointed her as Mode's Editor-in-Chief, but Daniel's objections based on the company charter blocked the appointment. Alexis and Wilhelmina's partnership later crumbled as Alexis reconciled with her brother; Wilhelmina then set her sights on seducing Bradford, manipulated him into divorcing Claire (the true owner of Mode) with the hope of marrying into the Meade family as a way to gain control of Mode. However, Bradford refused to relinquish Mode; Wilhelmina then plotted to sabotage Mode and start up her own magazine, Slater, in its wake once she married Bradford, but his heart attack at the altar and subsequent death squashed her claims to the Meade empire. Following this, she was immediately fired from Mode - but before leaving she crashed the Mode computers, causing them to lose an important upcoming issue. Taking advantage of the crisis, she convinced most of the Mode staff to work for Slater. The plans for Slater eventually fell apart as Wilhelmina was unable to secure the necessary funds. She then resorted to using Bradford's sperm (which Wilhelmina obtained immediately after his death by bribing a debt-ridden doctor) to produce a child in hope of claiming a substantial stake in the Meade empire; she intended to carry the child herself, but complications of a "hostile womb" led her to enlist Christina as a surrogate.</td>]]></html>

His womanizing and later prescription drug addiction stems from his unhappy, dysfunctional family life.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/i/g/n/Ignacio_Suarez_a7e5.html" title="Ignacio Suarez">Ignacio Suarez</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/t/o/n/Tony_Plana_19b7.html" title="Tony Plana">Tony Plana</a></td><td>Retired cook; former boxer</td><td>He spent 30 years in the United States as an illegal immigrant.

She was in league with Wilhelmina in plotting revenge against Bradford (in exchange for her loyalty, she promised Wilhelmina the editor job at MODE), but their schemes fell through as Alexis reconciled with Daniel and even attempted to make peace with her father, until she found out Bradford was plotting to get Alexis out of the country. In revenge, she hired a hitman to kill Bradford, but this plan backfired as the hitman had cut the brakes of Bradford's car that Alexis drove and crashed in a rush to get Daniel help following an overdose. After the accident Alexis suffered from retrograde amnesia, but has since remembered everything. Upon Bradford's death, she and Daniel fought over control of Meade Publications - which they'd settled though a paintball game in the MODE offices.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/c/l/a/Claire_Meade_726d.html" title="Claire Meade">Claire Meade</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/j/u/d/Judith_Light_9f89.html" title="Judith Light">Judith Light</a></td><td>Editor and owner of <i>Hot Flash</i>; owner of <i>Mode</i></td><td>A recovering alcoholic, she was upset over Bradford's numerous infidelities, especially over his twenty-year long affair with former MODE editor Fey Sommers. She had admitted to Betty that she killed Fey and attempted to leave the country in order to evade murder charges, but then turned herself in. When it was revealed that she was the true owner of <i>MODE</i>, Wilhelmina plotted to gain control by starting an affair with Bradford which led to his divorcing Claire in order to marry Wilhelmina; this action prompted Claire to escape from prison to stop Wilhelmina. After Bradford's death, Claire was sent back to prison to await her murder trial; she cleared of the crime when it was revealed Claire had unknowingly been under the influence of a poisonous perfume concocted by Fey that was meant to kill Claire, but instead the perfume had caused Claire to go insane and cause the events that led to Fey's demise. Now free, she soon found herself bored and neglected by her children; after meeting with other women with similar feelings of restlessness, she was inspired to start up her own magazine, entitled <i>Hot Flash</i>.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/h/e/n/Henry_Grubstick_6773.html" title="Henry Grubstick">Henry Grubstick</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christopher_Gorham_50ad.html" title="Christopher Gorham">Christopher Gorham</a></td><td>Accountant at Meade Publications</td><td>Originally from Tuscon, Arizona. At the series start he shared a flirtation with Betty, but didn't make any serious advances since she was still involved with Walter. However when Betty had finally broken up with Walter, Henry's ex-girlfriend Charlie had arrived from Tuscon to reconcile with Henry. Betty admitted to Henry she had feelings for him, but was uncomfortable staying friends with him and Charlie. He later broke up with Charlie in order to date Betty, but then Charlie dropped in on their first date to reveal she was pregnant with Henry's child. Despite the circumstances, he and Betty start up a relationship, ever present of the looming deadline and heartbreak in store for them.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/w/i/l/Wilhelmina_Slater_ccfa.html" title="Wilhelmina Slater">Wilhelmina Slater</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/v/a/n/Vanessa_L._Williams_ab61.html" title="Vanessa L. Williams">Vanessa Williams</a></td><td>Creative Director of <i>Mode</i></td><td>The series' chief antagonist. A respected figure in the fashion industry, she was passed over in favor of Daniel Meade for the Editor-in-Chief job at Mode after the death of Fey Sommers; she initially plotted to gain control on Mode by undermining Daniel's authority, often taking advantage of his inexperience. Wilhelmina was also in league with Alexis Meade, passing along information about the Meades while Alexis recovered from gender reassignment surgery and plotted to frame Bradford Meade for the murder of Fey Sommers. In exchange for Wilhelmina's loyalty, Alexis immediately appointed her as Mode's Editor-in-Chief, but Daniel's objections based on the company charter blocked the appointment. Alexis and Wilhelmina's partnership later crumbled as Alexis reconciled with her brother; Wilhelmina then set her sights on seducing Bradford, manipulated him into divorcing Claire (the true owner of Mode) with the hope of marrying into the Meade family as a way to gain control of Mode. However, Bradford refused to relinquish Mode; Wilhelmina then plotted to sabotage Mode and start up her own magazine, Slater, in its wake once she married Bradford, but his heart attack at the altar and subsequent death squashed her claims to the Meade empire. Following this, she was immediately fired from Mode - but before leaving she crashed the Mode computers, causing them to lose an important upcoming issue. Taking advantage of the crisis, she convinced most of the Mode staff to work for Slater. The plans for Slater eventually fell apart as Wilhelmina was unable to secure the necessary funds. She then resorted to using Bradford's sperm (which Wilhelmina obtained immediately after his death by bribing a debt-ridden doctor) to produce a child in hope of claiming a substantial stake in the Meade empire; she intended to carry the child herself, but complications of a "hostile womb" led her to enlist Christina as a surrogate.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/c/h/r/Christina_McKinney_37fd.html" title="Christina McKinney">Christina McKinney</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/a/s/h/Ashley_Jensen_f5c5.html" title="Ashley Jensen">Ashley Jensen</a></td><td>Seamstress at <i>MODE</i></td><td>She was the first person to befriend Betty when she arrived at Mode; with her knack for office gossip, she revealed to Betty about the true circumstances that led to Betty's hiring as Daniel's assistant. Despite her lack of trust in "the bitches at Mode" and especially Wilhelmina, she often became a willing pawn in Wilhelmina's schemes: as an aspiring fashion designer, Christina agreed to deliver evidence that would implicate Bradford Meade for the murder of Fey Sommers; in exchange Wilhelmina featured Christina's designs in the Mode fashion show. Christina admitted that she emigrated from Scotland five years prior to the first season, after abandoning her alcoholic husband Stuart. Stuart would later track Christina down at Mode, where he revealed he had severe liver damange and only had a few months to live, unless he secured the funds for an experimental treatment. Christina promised to get the money, but after her initial attempts failed, she reluctantly accepted Wilhelmina's offer in exchange to serve as the surrogate mother for Wilhelmina and Bradford Meade's child.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/a/m/a/Amanda_Tanen_b9d5.html" title="Amanda Tanen">Amanda Tanen</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/b/e/c/Becki_Newton_a323.html" title="Becki Newton">Becki Newton</a></td><td>Receptionist at <i>MODE</i></td><td>Initially hostile to Betty because she'd taken the job that Amanda was gunning for; along with Marc, she'd find ways to make Betty's job difficult - misplacing memos, "forgetting" to pass along messages, and being nasty in general. Amanda and Betty would later become 'frenemies' - joining forces when needed (such as when they were both in danger of losing their jobs) and confided in Betty about her unhappiness at being one of Daniel's many girlfriends. Despite knowing his reputation, she'd fallen in love with Daniel and hoped she'd be the one to change his ways. When it was clear that Daniel wasn't interested in getting to know Amanda beyond the bedroom, she broke off their relationship. Amanda later admitted she had gotten her job at Mode because her father dealt with the finances of the editor, Fey Sommers; she would later find out that Fey was actually her birth mother, who'd given Amanda up because Fey felt she couldn't devote her efforts to Mode and to being a mother at the same time. With this discovery, Amanda began a quest to find her biological father, as well as capitalize on her connection to the fashion legend to attain fame and respect.</td></tr><tr><td><a href="../../../../articles/m/a/r/Marc_St._James_693b.html" title="Marc St. James">Marc St. James</a></td><td><a href="../../../../articles/m/i/c/Michael_Urie_c558.html" title="Michael Urie">Michael Urie</a></td><td>Assistant to Wilhelmina Slater</td><td>Incredibly loyal to Wilhelmina, often deeply involved in her schemes to take over Mode and Meade Publications. Like Amanda, he was initially hostile to Betty but later became 'frenemies' when they were in danger of losing their jobs, as well as pretending to be a couple when Marc's overbearing mother visited. Betty had pushed a reluctant Marc to end the ruse and tell his mother that he was gay; he finally came out to his mother when she insulted Betty and her family, but she immediately rejected him.</td></tr></table>]]>
