	<text>*Note: Thelma&apos;s mother was shown on two occasions on the show (once in a flashback and once as a ghost, played both times by Vicki Lawrence), but her name was never revealed. Thelma mentions in &apos;&apos;Pomp and Consequences&apos;&apos; of having an older brother, Clyde.</text>

	<text>On the original &apos;Carol Burnett Show&apos; sketches we are introduced to five of Thelma&apos;s children: Ellen, Eunice (whom Ellen refers to as her &quot;little sister&quot; at one point), as well as younger sons Philip the Hollywood writer (who &quot;calls&quot; Thelma in one sketch and appears played by Roddy McDowell in another); Larry the artist (played by a very young Alan Alda in a Christmas sketch) and Jack (played by Tommy Smothers in a sketch where Eunice, Ed and Thelma visit him in the hospital). The three sons were far more sophisticated than their Harper relatives and were not included (or referred to) in the spin-off series. It is believed Vinton, never mentioned on &apos;The Carol Burnett&apos; show, was based on Jack and the character restructed to fit the spin-off.</text>

	<text>These inconsistencies can usually be rationalized by the changing of the Harper family structure between their introduction on The Carol Burnett Show and their inception on Mama&apos;s Family .</text>

<context>
	<score>0.52344453</score>
	<text>Another point of inconsistency within the show is the number, and order of birth, of Thelma s children. The general consensus was that Ellen was the oldest, Eunice was the middle, and Vinton was the youngest. This is supported a number of times throughout the run of the series, as several episodes featured flashbacks of Thelma s kids as children, where Vinton is seen noticeably younger than his sisters. In episode Rashomama, (a play on Rashamon ) however, Thelma refers to Eunice as her third born. Some have presumed that this was an intentional plot device by writers, who perhaps wanted to leave open the possibility of Thelma having another child. To add to this confusion, in episode Fran s Dress, Thelma claims that she once had four kids screaming around under her feet.</text>

	<text>After Buzz and Sonja move out, and Aunt Fran dies, Bubba moved in and is given Aunt Fran s bedroom. This upsets Vinton and Naomi, who had been forced to sleep in the basement and wanted the newly vacant room, but now couldn t have it. Fans have since frequently wondered whatever happened to the bedroom Sonja had slept in which had been mentioned to be Eunice and Ellen s childhood bedroom, which posed another question of where Vinton had slept as a child.</text>
