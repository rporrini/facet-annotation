	<text>The concept of traveling through space encountering aliens and strange worlds is similar to Star Trek and Lost In Space , although the production&apos;s visual aesthetics were heavily influenced by 2001: A Space Odyssey . In another nod to Kubrick&apos;s epic, the first series of Space: 1999 tended to explore mystical and metaphysical themes, although the revamped second series would center on more &quot;action-oriented&quot; plots and dynamic character interaction.</text>

	<text>The underlying storyline of Space: 1999 centered on the plight of the inhabitants of Moonbase Alpha following a calamity on September 13 , 1999 . A huge nuclear waste dump on the far side of the Moon detonates in a massive thermonuclear explosion, initiated by the buildup of magnetic radiation which was released, causing a nuclear chain reaction . The force of the explosion causes the Moon to be sent hurtling out of Earth &apos;s orbit and into deep space at colossal speed, stranding the 311 crew members, in effect becoming the &quot;spaceship&quot; on which our heroes travel, looking for a new home. During their interstellar journey, the Alphans encounter a vast array of alien civilizations, dystopian societies, and strange phenomena previously unseen by man.</text>

	<text>In the US , efforts to sell the television series to the major networks failed and as a result it was syndicated to local stations. In the months leading to the beginning of the fall ( autumn ) 1975 television season (in the US, September is traditionally the month in which new TV series begin), Landau and Bain participated in special preview screenings in select cities [4] . Landau is said to have personally contacted editors of the widely read and influential TV Guide magazine in some markets to secure coverage of Space: 1999 in its pages upon learning of ITC&apos;s somewhat poor promotional efforts. While most of the US stations that aired Space: 1999 were independent (such as powerful Chicago station WGN-TV , Los Angeles station KHJ-TV , and New York City &apos;s WPIX-TV ), a handful were affiliated with the major networks (such as San Francisco &apos;s KRON-TV , at the time a strong NBC affiliate) and sometimes pre-empted regular network programming to show episodes of the series; most US stations broadcast the episodes in the weekday evening hour just before prime time or on weekends. The series was broadcast in 96 countries, mostly from 1975-79. However, it aired in its entirety in very few countries. Often there were long gaps between first run and rerun or even within first run, and rarely were episodes shown in a coherent sequence.</text>

	<text>The series premiered in 1975, although the first episode had actually been filmed in 1973. Live action was filmed at Pinewood Studios and special effects at Bray Studios . There were two seasons of 24 episodes each made by Gerry Anderson for ITC Entertainment . The first season was co-produced by the Italian state broadcaster, RAI . As part of this production agreement, various episodes featured Italian actors in guest-starring roles. In Britain the series was originally seen on ITV stations but never simulcast nationally.</text>

	<text>With Freiberger&apos;s arrival, numerous changes were made for Year 2. The most visible change was the absence of Professor Bergman ( Barry Morse ). Morse&apos;s departure was due to a salary dispute, but he would later claim he was glad to leave, and told Anderson: &quot;I would rather play with grown-ups for a while.&quot; ( Morse 2004 , pp. 287-288) With Morse gone, this led to the addition of Catherine Schell as the resident alien Maya . Her character could provide &quot;outside observation of human behavior&quot; as provided by the character of Mr. Spock on Star Trek . Maya shared Spock&apos;s logical approach to problem-solving, but differed in that she was a fully emotional person. Most importantly, however, her abilities as a shapeshifter , which allowed her to molecularly transform into any creature for an hour at a time, were designed to add a certain &quot;wow&quot; factor to the newly-revamped series. (Ms. Schell had previously guest starred in the Year 1 episode Guardian of Piri ).</text>

	<text>Freiberger emphasized action-adventure in Year 2 stories to the exclusion of metaphysical themes explored in Year 1. Of Year 1, he commented, &quot;They were doing the show as an English show, where there was no story, with the people standing around and talking. In the first show I did, I stressed action as well as character development, along with strong story content, to prove that 1999 could stand up to the American concept of what an action-adventure show should be.&quot; ( Starlog 40 1980 , pp. 58-61) Since Year 1 was quite serious in tone, one of Frieberger&apos;s ways to accomplish this objective was to inject humor into Year 2 stories whenever possible, but much of it seemed to fans as forced, especially at the conclusion of an episode, where the Alphans were seen as jovial and light-hearted despite whatever violent or tragic events may have previously befallen them.</text>

	<text>Members of the Space: 1999 cast became disenchanted with the scripts. Martin Landau: &quot;They changed it because a bunch of American minds got into the act and they decided to do many things they felt were commercial. Fred Freiberger helped in some respects, but, overall, I don&apos;t think he helped the show, I think he brought a much more ordinary, mundane approach to the series.&quot; ( Starlog 108 1986 , pp. 44-47) . Under the pseudonym of Charles Woodgrove, Fred Freiberger wrote three episodes, The Rules of Luton , The Beta Cloud and Space Warp , known pejoratively as the &quot;Woodgrove Trilogy&quot; for its simplistic approach to storytelling. One particular episode ( All That Glisters , which dealt with the threat of an intelligent rock) was of such allegedly deficient quality that it sparked a confrontation between Freiberger and the cast. Landau disliked the story so strongly that he wrote the following notes on his copy of the script: &quot;All the credibility we&apos;re building up is totally forsaken in this script!&quot;; &quot;...Story is told poorly!&quot;; and &quot;The character of Koenig takes a terrible beating in this script We&apos;re all shmucks!&quot; Anholt revealed that, &quot;the more the cast complained about a script&apos;s flaws, the more intractable and unyielding Freiberger became.&quot;</text>

	<text>Alas, the presentation of Year 2 was not as consistent elsewhere in the world. Some Year 2 episodes did not air in the UK until nearly two years after they were produced. Plans were nevertheless put in place for a third season, but dropping ratings and a resulting lack of syndication and commercial sponsor sales led to the series&apos; cancellation. Landau later faulted ITC Entertainment president Lew Grade &apos;s foray into film production ; the projected budget for the third season was, coincidentally, equivalent to the advertising budget for Raise the Titanic! , and it came down to one or the other ( Starlog 108 1986 , pp. 44-47) .</text>
