Manually annotated datasets used in this VLDB 2010 paper:

Girija Limaye, Sunita Sarawagi, and Soumen Chakrabarti. Annotating and searching web tables using entities, types and relationships. In Proc. of the 36th Int'l Conference on Very Large Databases (VLDB), 2010.

This directory contains the raw tables grouped by dataset and the
corresponding annotations appear in the
"workspace/WWT_GroundTruth/annotation" directories.

The directories are nested several levels deep and both the table and
annotation  directories follow the same nesting.  
Each table is a separate xml file with a self-explaining tag structure.
Ditto for its annotation.

Not all annotations are marked for all tables. Completions and
corrections are welcome. Please mail these to sunita@iitb.ac.in
